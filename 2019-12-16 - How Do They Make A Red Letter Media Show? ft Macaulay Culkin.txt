https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e56SnwL4aE

NARRATOR:
Here at Red Letter Media, if everyone's doing their jobs, you'll never notice just how much work goes on behind the scenes.
Hello.
I'm a British person.
Join us as we follow a new Red Letter Media intern as they prepare for a very special episode.
Today's shoot features a special celebrity guest.
And it's about time to wake them up!
His contract stipulates that he be awoken by the smell of freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies every morning.
Such are the perks of being a real Hollywood celebrity!
Now it's time to wake the intern.

MACAULAY:
Not the bees!

RICH:
Time to get up, newbie.

MACAULAY:
Life as an intern isn't easy, but if young Macaulay works hard, maybe some day he too can be a star.
First things first.
The intern changes into his official work uniform.
Looking good, kid.
The hopeful intern attempts to enter the forbidden room.
Denied once again.
Better luck tomorrow.
Tthe intern wastes no time tending to his daily chores.
Here we see him cooking breakfast for the talent.
All Red Letter Media interns are physically much weaker than the on-screen talent.
That's a promise.
The talent have strict dietary requirements.
Young Macaulay can't afford to make even the smallest error.
After all, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
Without breakfast, we'd be little more than animals, shivering in the wild, driven mad by the sound of thunder, mothers cannibalizing their young for lunch.
Yes, we'd all be lost without breakfast.
Once the team is fed, it's time to get them camera-ready.

MACAULAY:
I know I'm in the minority here, but Discovery, only reason to have CBS+

NARRATOR:
For Mike, this mostly consists of making sure he never looked too happy.
For Jay, it means painstakingly applying his beard, one hair at a time.

JAY:
Tell me I'm beautiful, intern.

MACAULAY:
You're beautiful.

JAY:
Silence!

NARRATOR:
Next, the intern print shirts in a garage so that he can restock the Red Letter Media store.
It looks like he's earned a break!
If Macaulay works hard, someday maybe they'll let him into the break room.

NARRATOR:
Some day.
The boys in charge are tough, but fair.

MIKE:
You know, that break is coming out of your fucking paycheck.

MACAULAY:
I thought I was being paid in experience?

JAY:
That's right.
And now you'll never experience unconditional love.

MACAULAY:
Oh, gee whiz.

NARRATOR:
You know, we're shooting a new Best of the Worst tonight, and we have a special celebrity guest.
So we need you to go meet with our "contact" to get some fresh VHS tapes.

MACAULAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
And don't get shot again.

NARRATOR:
This is a rare treat.
A glimpse at how the team acquires the very best of terrible VHS cassettes.

VHS SELLER:
Were you followed?

MACAULAY:
Nope.

VHS SELLER:
You got the money?
It's guaranteed to be the worst films you've ever seen.
Seriously.
You're gonna hate it.

MACAULAY:
Great.

VHS SELLER:
I'm sorry.

NARRATOR:
Success.

VHS SELLER:
Damn.

NARRATOR:
It's the interns job to watch all of the tapes and make sure they meet the team's rigid standards of best, but also worst.
Looks like this one wasn't quite up to "snuff".
It's almost time for the most important job of all: shooting today's video.
The intern has to change into his showbusiness uniform.
The talent have already arrived.
These consummate professionals wait on their marks hours in advance.
As the only Red Letter Media intern, Macaulay has his hands full.
He is almost ready to begin filming.

MACAULAY:
And, action!

NARRATOR:
But it looks like he's forgotten something.
Let's hope he notices soon.
Otherwise, poor Macaulay may never graduate from the intern program.
He uses flakes barley and only the finest Wisconsin malts.
A perfect farmhouse ale.
A visitor?
At this hour?

MACAULAY:
This is gonna end well.

NARRATOR:
Edged weapon attacks are a common occurrence at the Red Letter Media studios.
Fortunately, the intern is trained for this.

MACAULAY:
Knife!

ATTACKER:
Where?
Ah!

MACAULAY:
Hi-ya!
Hee-yah!

NARRATOR:
Perfect technique.
Top-notch interning.
We are approaching the moment of truth.
If the intern has done well, theu'll invite him to join them.
Fingers crossed.

MIKE:
Mmm!
That's a perfect farmhouse ale!
Well, hello everyone, and welcome to Best of the Worst.
I'm Mike.

RICH:
I'm Rich.

JAY:
I'm Jay.

MIKE:
And today we watched three crazy scary movies on our very scary Christmas episode of Best of the Worst.

JAY:
That's trademarked.

MIKE:
That's trademark, Jay.
That's right.

JAY:
No one, no one has ever used that expression before.

MIKE:
No one has ever said:
"Have a scary Christmas."

JAY:
Never, never happened.

MIKE:
We watched a bunch of Christmas-themed horror films on this episode, and...
Oh.
Hey.
Aren't we missing somebody?
It's usually four people on the panel, right?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Hmm.

MIKE:
Huh.
Is it that fucking intern again?

JAY:
Oh, Jesus Christ.

RICH:
Oh, fuck.

MACAULAY:
I'm so sorry.

JAY:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
I'm so sorry I'm late.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
It's all right.

RICH:
It's, it's fine.
It's fine.

JAY:
It's fine this time.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Don't let it happen again.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You, you gotta mic up!
Jesus Christ.

MACAULAY:
Stop yelling at me!

MIKE:
Yeah, you spilled a little.

RICH:
Fucking rookies.
Where do we get these people?

JAY:
I don't know.

RICH:
Where the fuck did this guy come from?

MIKE:
Craigslist.

RICH:
Ugh.

MIKE:
I know.
It's embarrassing.

RICH:
I thought you got him from Fiverr.

MIKE:
I got him from Fourr.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
Oh.

MIKE:
Discount version.
Yeah.
It's embarrassing.

MACAULAY:
I can hear you!

MIKE:
Oh.

NARRATOR:
Attaboy, Macaulay.
We'll make a real Hollywood celebrity out of you yet.

MACAULAY:
Well, that certainly was a fun engaging video, wasn't it?
