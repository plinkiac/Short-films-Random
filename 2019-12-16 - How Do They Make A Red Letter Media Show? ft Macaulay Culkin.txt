https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e56SnwL4aE

here at redlettermedia if everyone's doing their jobs you'll never notice just how much work goes on behind the scenes
hello
I'm a British person
join us as we follow a new redlettermedia intern because they prepare for a very special episode
today's shoot features a special celebrity guest, and it's about time to wake them up
his contract stipulates that he be awoken by the smell of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies every morning
such other perks of being a real Hollywood celebrity
now it's time to wake the intern
time to get up, newbie
life as an intern isn't easy
but if young Macaulay works hard maybe some day he too can be a star
first things first
the intern changes into his official work uniform
looking good, kid
the hopeful intern attempts to enter the forbidden room
denied once again
better luck tomorrow
the intern wastes no time tending to his daily chores
here we see him cooking breakfast for the talent
all redlettermedia interns are physically much weaker than the on-screen talent
that's a promise
the talent have strict dietary requirements
young Macaulay can't afford to make even the smallest error
after all, breakfast is the most important meal of the day
without breakfast, we'd be little more than animals, shivering in the wild, driven mad by the sound of thunder, mothers cannibalizing their young for lunch
yes, we'd all be lost without breakfast
once the team is fed, it's time to get them camera-ready
I know I'm in the minority here, but discovery, only reason to have CBS+
for Mike, this mostly consists of making sure he never looked too happy
for Jay, it means painstakingly applying his beard, one hair at a time
tell me I'm beautiful, intern
you're beautiful
silence
perfection
next, the intern print shirts
in a garage so that he can restock the redlettermedia store
it looks like he's earned a break
if Macaulay works hard,, someday maybe they'll let him into the break room
some day
the boys in charge are tough, but fair
you know, that break is coming out of your fucking paycheck
I thought I was being paid in experience
that's right
and now you'll never experience unconditional love
oh, gee whiz
you know, we're shooting a new best of the worst tonight, and we have a special celebrity guest
so we need you to go meet with our contact to get some fresh VHS tapes
okay
don't get shot again
this is a rare treat a glimpse at how the team acquires the very best of terrible VHS cassettes
were you followed
nope
you got the money
it's guaranteed to be the worst films you've ever seen
seriously
you're gonna hate it
great
I'm sorry
success
damn
it's the interns job to watch all of the tapes and make sure they meet the team's rigid standards of best, but also worst
"oh, my god, no"
looks like this one wasn't quite up to snuff
it's almost time for the most important job of all
shooting today's video
the intern has to change into his showbusiness uniform
the talent have already arrived
these consummate professionals wait on their marks hours in advance
as the only redlettermedia intern, Macaulay has his hands full
he is almost ready to begin filming
and, action
but it looks like he's forgotten something
let's hope he notices soon
otherwise, poor Macaulay may never graduate from the intern program
he uses flakes barley and only the finest Wisconsin malts
a perfect farmhouse ale
a visitor at this hour
this is gonna end well
edged weapon attacks are a common occurrence at the redlettermedia studios
fortunately, the intern is trained for this
knife
where
perfect technique
top-notch interning
we are approaching the moment of truth
if the intern has done well, theu'll invite him to join them
fingers crossed
mmm, that's a perfect farmhouse ale
well, hello everyone, and welcome to best of the worst
I'm Mike
I'm rich
I'm Jay
and today we watched three crazy scary movies on our very scary Christmas episode of best of the worst
that's trademarked
that's trademark, jay
that's right
no one, no one has ever used that expression before
no one has ever said, have a scary Christmas
never, never happened
so we watched a bunch of Christmas themed horror films on this episode, and
oh
hey
aren't we missing somebody
it's usually four people on the panel, right
yeah
hmm
huh
is it that fucking intern again 
oh, fuck
i'm so sorry
sorry, i'm late
oh
that's all right
it's, it's fine
it's fine
it's fine this time
yeah
yeah
don't let it happen again
yeah
you, you got a mic up
stop yelling at me
yeah, you spilled a little
fucking rookies
where do we get these people
where the fuck did this guy come from Craigslist
ugh
i know
it's embarrassing
I thought you got him from Fiverr
mmm
I got him from fourr
oh
