[Episode #1]

HONEY:
You know, you really should be doing this, since I just had spine surgery.

CLIFF:
Oh, you'll manage, Honey. Besides, I'm watching the baby.

HONEY:
Okay, Cliff. I'm gonna go take out the trash now. So if I'm not back in five minutes, I want you to call the police, and tell them there's been a violent rape in the alley behind our apartment. Oh, god. Oh, god. Oh! Oh, my spine! Ow! Oh! Ow-w-w! Did you call the police?

CLIFF:
Nope!

HONEY:
Oh, god. Oh, god, no, no! Get away! Oh, my god!

CLIFF:
Hey! You forgot to put a new bag in the garbage can!

[Episode #2]

HONEY:
Darn meat pies. I like me some meat pies. Hi, Cliff.

CLIFF:
Hi, Honey.

HONEY:
How's it going?

CLIFF:
Well...

HONEY:
What happened?

CLIFF:
Well, I was going to the dollar store to get some condoms, and this lady kind of came out in front of my car.

HONEY:
Did you hit somebody?

CLIFF:
Yeah, I mean...yeah. It was an old lady. She came out right in front of me. I was only going about 125 miles an hour.

HONEY:
Oh, my god. What did the police say?

CLIFF:
Well, I didn't call the police.

HONEY:
You left the scene of an accident without calling the police? What if she was dead?

CLIFF:
Honey, there was blood all over the fucking car and the street. I mean, I picked the bumper up. I tried to hide it in the trunk and get the hell out of there.

HONEY:
No, Cliff. I don't care about the car. What about the woman?

CLIFF:
Well, I did go up to her. She said, um, "Help me! Oh, god! I'm dying1"

HONEY:
Oh, Cliff, if she's still alive, you can't leave her like that. You've gotta go back, Cliff! You've gotta finish it!

[Episode #3]

EMPLOYEE:
Hi, sir. Can I help you?

CLIFF:
Yeah, yeah, you can help me. I've got a leak at home I'm trying to fix.

EMPLOYEE:
I sure can help you with that. What kind of leak is it?

CLIFF:
It's my wife's mouth. It won't quit running.

EMPLOYEE:
Good one, sir.

CLIFF:
No, but, uh, seriously. I'll take a double cheeseburger combo meal. Uh, no onions. Large fry. Large coke, too.

EMPLOYEE:
Seriously, sir. How can I help you?

CLIFF:
I just told you my order!

EMPLOYEE:
Sir...you're in a hardware store.

CLIFF:
What? What?

EMPLOYEE:
Phil, call the police.

CLIFF:
What? What? What? You're mine!

[Episode #4]

CLIFF:
Honey, I fucking love this lamp. Probably one of the best investments we've ever made. Only 10% interest. You know, we can have this paid off in a couple of years. Oh, yeah. I'm gonna turn this thing on and off all night. Kind of like you, Honey, except for the on part. Honey, are you listening to me?

HONEY:
Cliff...what time is it?

CLIFF:
Honey, if I could tell time, I would've divorced you long ago. Besides, what you do care what time it is? You don't work. In fact, an M. Night Shyamalan film has a better chance of working than you do.

HONEY:
I know, but I ordered our groceries online today, and they should be here any minute.

CLIFF:
You what? Jesus Christ, how much is that gonna fucking cost us?

HONEY:
Nothing. It's totally free! It's a brand new state program where we don't have to use our food stamps anymore. All we gotta do is select the groceries we want online. They deliver it right to our door. There's no limit. Best part is, it's free. Free!

CLIFF:
Mm! I remember tearing up a letter about that, I think.

HONEY:
You know, I think it's just supposed to be for retarded and disabled people, but since I just got diagnosed with tired feet syndrome, I think I qualify.

CLIFF:
Honey, I have a confession that I'd like to make. I killed Heath Ledger.

HONEY:
Anyways, since it's a brand new program, the closest store that's participating is in Madison.

CLIFF:
Madison? That's like 60 miles away. 

HONEY:
That's very accurate. It's free grocery time! Free grocery time! Free grocery time! Free grocery time! Free grocery time!

CHAD VADER:
Government groceries for, um, uh, Grabowski's? 

HONEY:
That's us! Thank you! Bye now!

CHAD VADER:
Wait. Wait. I need to sit down and rest. I rode all the way here from Madison...on a little girl's bicycle.

HONEY:
All right. Come on in.

CLIFF:
Honey, why did Darth Vader just deliver our groceries?

CHAD VADER:
The one you speak of is my brother. I am Chad Vader. I am a manager at a grocery store.

CLIFF:
Why are they laughing?

HONEY:
Because a Darth Vader is a dark, serious, opposing figure. And when he does something silly or out of character, it's instantly funny.

DARTH VADER:
I just made some cookies! Would anyone like some? What? What's so funny? Would you like to add more sprinkles? I can add more sprinkles! Mmm! I'm the lollipop man! I love the lollis! The lollipops are mighty tasty! Who's coming to the hoedown with me, partner? Yeehaw. Yeehaw. Yeehaw.

HONEY:
Time to go!

CLIFF:
It's time to go, pal.

HONEY:
All right, thanks a lot, thanks for stopping by.

CHAD VADER:
No! Stop pushing me! I want to stay!

CLIFF:
Ah, Christ! What now?

CLIFF:
Oh, it's the carpet sample guy! He was supposed to come here today, too!

CLIFF:
Honey.

HONEY:
What a day.

THE CROW:
Hello, I'm The Crow. I'm here to show you your carpet samples today.

CLIFF:
Oh, my god.

HONEY:
Come on in.

THE CROW:
What? I got my revenge. I needed work. And since my only experience was getting revenge, the only job I could get is showing these fucking carpet samples.

CHAD VADER:
Oh, boy. That's funny.

CLIFF:
Ah, carpet samples.

THE CROW:
Stop laughing at me! You want me to show you these fucking carpet samples or not?

CLIFF:
Who's next?

HONEY:
Let's go find out!

CLIFF:
Excuse me, Darth.

HONEY:
Excuse me, Crow. It's the T-1000!

CLIFF:
No, no, no. It's the Maniac Cop!

HONEY:
Ooh!

CLIFF:
Ooh! He's gonna write you a ticket!

HONEY:
No, no, no, no. It's Barney Fife!

CLIFF:
No, he looks nothing like Barney Fife. You're crazy.

OFFICER PERKINS:
Pardon me, folks, but are you Honey Grawboski?

HONEY:
Mm-hmm.

OFFICER PERKINS:
Well, I'm Officer Perkins from the Milwaukee Police Department. I'm sorry to inform you, but your entire family has just died in a horrible fire. Oh, and I guess your baby died, too.

CHAD VADER:
I, I should be going now. I've got to back to my store. Yes, that's it. Excuse me. Pardon me.

OFFICER PERKINS:
I don't know what else to say.

CHAD VADER:
I forgot my cookies. Yes, I'll just be a moment while I get those. Ooh! Ow! Geez! Um...ahh! Ooh, I'm so sorry.

CLIFF:
Fucking get out!

CHAD LEAVER:
I'm leaving now.

[Episode #5]

CLIFF:
Hello? Jury duty? Oh, Shake 'n Bake.

[Episode #6]

CLIFF:
Did you know Kathie Lee Gifford did a gang bang? Wow. Oh, the phone's ringing. Hello? Excuse me here. Hello? Jury Duty? Yeah, right. Did you know Kathie Lee Gifford did a gang bang?

[Episode #7]

CLIFF:
Honey, I can't get this walnut open.

[Episode #8]

HONEY:
Cliff?

CLIFF:
Yeah?

HONEY:
Do you ever feel like our lives have been just a complete waste.

CLIFF:
Yeah.

HONEY:
I wonder who that could be?

CLIFF:
I don't know. Let's go find out.

SHAMSEN SHONSENSEN:
Hello, are you the Grazblowski's?

BOTH:
Yeah.

SHAMSEN SHONSENSEN:
My name is Shamsen Shonsensen. And I'm here from the city, and I have to tell you that your building is being demolished, and you have fifteen minutes to leave.

CLIFF:
Oh...

SHAMSEN SHONSENSEN:
Thank you. Have a good day.

CLIFF:
That's not a lot of time.

HONEY:
No.

CLIFF:
All right. Then I guess, get your stuff. Take the pigeon, and my iPhone. All right! That's everything.

HONEY:
What are we gonna do now?

CLIFF:
Well, I was gonna open a bar called Cliff's Place. And you can be dead.

HONEY:
Or, we could just stay at my mother's.

CLIFF:
Yeah, I guess. Let's go. 

HONEY:
You know what? I'm really gonna miss this place.

CLIFF:
Me, too, Honey. We had a lot of good times here.

HONEY:
Cliff, did you see that, too?

CLIFF:
Yeah, I did. And let's never speak of it again. Let's go! Thank you. Honey, I cannot believe we forgot the toaster.
