JONATHAN FRAKES:
Mike Stoklasa.
I hope I got that right.
And Rich Evans.
My name is Jonathan Frakes.
Commander Riker from Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Your fans have reached out to me so I could send some words of encouragement.
So, Mike.
Rich.
You're doing a great job on your YouTube channel.
And, remember, this pandemic, this COVID nightmare will pass.
Stay safe.
Social distance.
Wear the mask.
Red alert.
Shields up.
Arm the aft photon torpedoes.
Make it so.
Engage.
And all the other Next Gen tropes you can think of.
Mike.
Rich.
May you live long, and propser.
That's from your friends, and me.
Enjoy.
Bye-bye.
