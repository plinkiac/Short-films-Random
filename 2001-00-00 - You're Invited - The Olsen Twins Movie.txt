Aloha, little man!

PLINKETT:
Hello!
My name's Mr. Plinkett, and I got a problem.

MARY KATE:
Problem in paradise?

PLINKETT:
My life ain't no paradise!
There's a fucking problem.

ASHLEY:
So what's the poop, Mr. Plinkus?

BOTH:
A paradise of sun and surf and sand!

PLINKETT:
Sand?
Nerf?

MARY KATE:
Sounds like fun!

PLINKETT:
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

ASHLEY:
What's the matter?
Sun not shining?

PLINKETT:
I called to talk about my legs.

MARY KATE:
Surf not surfing?

PLINKETT:
My legs don't work!

ASHLEY:
Sand not sanding?

PLINKETT:
Look, I got a lot of problems here.
A lot of things are missing.
My legs...my legs don't work.
And I can't find my cab.

BOTH:
Misplaced?

PLINKETT:
No, no, it's a cabinet.

MARY KATE:
It does seem like you have a puzzle, Mr. Plinkus.

PLINKETT:
No, it's not a puzzle.

ASHLEY:
Sounds like you do have a problem in paradise!

PLINKETT:
Ehh, enough about my cabinet.
You girls solve mysteries, right?
Well, I gotta medical mystery.
I can't find my pills?
So why don't you come over here and investigate me?

ASHLEY:
We don't usually investigate dirty rotten scoundrels.

PLINKETT:
Oh, god.
I'm gonna go kill myself with my cabinet.

ASHLEY:
Cry no more, Mr. Plinkus.
We're on our way!

PLINKETT:
Hello?
Oh, it must be the girls here to fix my cabinet.
My wheels!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Oh, why did I buy stairs?
Okay...oh, god!
Oh, god!

MARY KATE:
You guys can put your stuff right here.

KATHERINE:
I'm so excited.

ALEXANDRA:
Me, too.

KATHERINE:
I'm hungry.

ALEXANDRA:
Me, too.
Do we have any food?

MARY KATE:
Of course we do!

ASHLEY:
Yeah, special camping food!

KATHERINE:
What's special camping food?

ALEXANDRA:
Oh, my gosh!
Look at all of that stuff!

MARY KATE:
Juices.

ASHLEY:
Gotta have marshmallows.

RICH:
I think marshmallows would be great!
Why, we can make s'mores.
What do you think?

ASHLEY:
Cookies?

MARY KATE:
Gotta have marshmallows.

ASHLEY:
Can't have hot dogs without the buns!

MARY KATE:
If we eat this much on the trip, we won't be able to do a thing!

ASHLEY:
Maybe!
But just think, it'll be so much fun deciding what we wanna eat for a change!

KATHERINE:
Yeah.

ALEXANDRA:
Yeah.

MARY KATE:
Oh.

ASHLEY:
So do I.

KATHERINE:
Do we have to carry all this stuff?

ASHLEY:
Yeah, Alex.
It goes with us.

SOFIA CLIMENCO:
Do not test me, foolish one.
I am all powerful!

RICH:
Ow!
Oh, oh!
Ow, my groin!

KEVIN:
It's pretty good.

PLINKETT:
This was a fucking problem.
My life ain't no paradise!

ASHLEY:
Sounds like you do have a problem in paradise!

PLINKETT:
No, no!
I said my life ain't no fucking paradise!

BOTH:
Stolen!

PLINKETT:
A lot of things are missing!

MARY KATE:
All right, Mr. Plinkus.
What kind of things are missing?

PLINKETT:
I got pills!
And I need you to come over and investigate my illness.

MARY KATE:
Most of our mysteries are about ghosts...

PLINKETT:
What?

MARY KATE:
...dragons, monsters.
You know, that kind of stuff.

PLINKETT:
I can't understand what you're saying about no goblins.
I haven't got no goblins or ghosts.

MARY KATE:
Sounds like fun!

PLINKETT:
What?

BOTH:
A paradise of sun, surf, and sand!

PLINKETT:
No, I said I got a medical mystery!

ASHLEY:
What's the matter?

PLINKETT:
I can't find my legs.
You girls need to come over here and, and fix them up for me.
I got some tools and a screwdriver.
Can you use the screwdriver to fix my legs?
I couldn't work it on the cabinet because I can't kneel down.
