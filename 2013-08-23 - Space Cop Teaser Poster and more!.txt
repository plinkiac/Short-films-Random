hi, everyone
I'm mike
and i'm jay
and we're here to tell you that we have a new teaser poster for our next film space cop
and it's available now in our store
that's right, mike
it's the poster before the official poster
why are we selling a poster
to help us keep making the movie
what movie
space cop
oh, right
space cop
here's the, uh, original artwork
that's right, jay
this artwork was created by dc comics artist, freddie williams
artist on such titles as the flash, robin, green arrow, as well as author of dc comics guide to digitally drawing comics
and now we can add space cop to his resume
even rich evans isn't adding space cop to his resume
so, jay, what else are we here to tell people about
that's right, mike
we're also in the process of updating our iphone app, with some new free shit, like a half in the bag sound board
with new sounds like
oh, my god
I crapped my pants
it does smell a bit like an open grave in here
oh, my god
I'm having a fucking heart attack
who would want any of this crap
so if you haven't picked up the official red lettermedia iphone app
what are you waiting for
daddy needs his milk money
oh, my god, jay
you okay
no, I'm not okay, you fucking asshole
my hair's falling out, and i hate you
jay, are the stresses of shooting segments for doc of the dead, as well as making an entire feature-length film, as well as shooting and editing new episodes of half in the bag and best of the worst starting to get to you
