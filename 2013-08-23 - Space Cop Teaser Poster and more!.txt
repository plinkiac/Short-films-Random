MIKE:
Hi, everyone.
I'm Mike.

JAY:
And I'm Jay.

MIKE:
And we're here to tell you that we have a new teaser poster for our next film Space Cop.
And it's available now in our store.

JAY:
That's right, Mike.
It's the poster before the official poster.

MIKE:
Why are we selling a poster?

JAY:
To help us keep making the movie.

MIKE:
What movie?

JAY:
Space Cop.

MIKE:
Oh, right.
Space Cop.

JAY:
Uh, here's the, uh, original artwork.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.
This artwork was created by DC Comics artist, Freddie Williams.
Artist on such titles as The Flash, Robin, Green Arrow, as well as author of DC Comics Guide to Digitally Drawing Comics.

JAY:
And now he can add Space Cop to his resume!

MIKE:
Even Rich Evans isn't adding Space Cop to his resume.
So, Jay, what else are we here to tell people about?

JAY:
That's right, Mike.
We're also in the process of updating our iPhone app, with some new free shit, like a Half in the Bag sound board.

MIKE:
With new sounds like...

RICH:
Oh, my god!
I crapped my pants!

JAY:
It does smell a bit like an open grave in here.

RICH:
Oh, my god!
I'm having a fucking heart attack.

MIKE:
Who would want any of this crap?

JAY:
So if you haven't picked up the official Red Letter Media iPhone app, what are you waiting for?
Daddy needs his milk money!

MIKE:
Oh, my god, Jay.
You okay?

JAY:
No, I'm not okay, you fucking asshole!
My hair's falling out, and I hate you!
Jay, are the stresses of shooting segments for Doc of the Dead, as well as making an entire feature-length film, as well as shooting and editing new episodes of Half in the Bag and Best of the Worst starting to get to you?

RICH:
Ah-choo!
