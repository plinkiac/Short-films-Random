In a crossover event for the ages, Macaulay Culkin and Red Letter Media got together to take on Milwaukee.
Specifically, pointing at stuff.
And it was everything you ever could have wanted … and more (maybe?).

Mack and Mike stopped by a statue of The Fonz, The Harley-Davidson Museum, Bombers (which we guess is a Milwaukee thing?), and not one, but several elaborate and strangely-placed street sculptures.
Oh, there’s more.
Mack and Mike also pointed at signs, graffiti that said “cum” (classic), and forced Jay to drink wine.
And yes, that’s Macaulay Culkin’s dulcet tones you’re hearing throughout the entire video.
