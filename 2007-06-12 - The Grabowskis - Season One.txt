Honey, who are all these people in this photo album?
Your family.
Honey, why isn't the coffee pot working?
Because we don't have one.
Honey, I've been going over our financial records, and it seems that our money is gone.
Honey, I think little Sammy needs to go to the doctor.
No, he doesn't.
Honey, is this hot?
Yes.
Honey, I think we should get a Costco membership.
What?
Well, it's a really good investment.
The hell's wrong with you? That's sickening.
Well, we could buy bulk in items like toilet paper or dog food.
I can't believe you're even suggesting this. It's fucking gross. Oh, a Costco membership.
Honey, it's three o'clock. I think we need to pick the kids up from school.
We picked them up yesterday.
Honey, I've been sleeping around. I think you should get a divorce.
Damn it.
