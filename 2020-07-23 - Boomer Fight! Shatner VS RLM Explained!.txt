Hello, and welcome to the Mike and Jay podcast on YouTube.
Today, we're going to talk about some current events.
Some Star Trek.
And I happen to have, right here, an actual Star Trek phaser.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
Now, this is the same kind of phaser they used in Star Trek: The Original Series, the 1960s TV show.
so this is the phaser that captain kirk
would use
when battling the klingorns
kirk enterprise beam us up
how do you keep track of all this star
trek information jay you know
just years of watching the shows movies
you know i just i'm an encyclopedia of
knowledge
but we're here today to talk about not
just star trek
but some new information that's happened
on twitter
and we're here to explain it to the best
of our ability
twitter aka the worst place on the
internet
oh i've seen worse
hey mike why is everybody tweeting at us
about william shatner
because william shatner is tweeting at
us even though he blocked us
well why i legitimately have no
understanding of what is going on so i
need you to explain to me
this twitter kerfuffle yes um that's why
we're here today
because uh we've been getting messages
and
we've been seeing threads and tweets
about this william shatner
they call it a boomer fight and
we are not fighting with william shatner
we haven't even talked to him we haven't
even talked to him technically
we have nothing to do with this we
didn't invite him onto our podcast
that's number one number one william
shatner
and people out there we did not invite
william shannon to come on our podcast
or any of our shows no people did
originally this all started august of
2019
someone said william shatner you should
go on red letter media
to that shatner replies i don't know who
they are
he was talking about red letter day by
the pet shop boys
so there's some confusion right off the
bat was he trying to make a joke
don't know is he always trying to make a
joke
and you know what just to lay this right
out on the table i don't even know if
william shatner's you know verified
account is actually william shatner
could be a lot of celebrities have have
people that take care of their
social media accounts for him and then i
wrote back
oh bill how could you not have heard of
us
we are formerly called the pet shop
dudes so i understand the confusion
oh then he replied to us i had a look at
your link
which i didn't send a link i think he
meant i clicked on
someone probably sent him a video of
ours or something in those replies and
he might have been replying to somebody
else yeah but but or he could have
clicked on our twitter and then went oh
what's you know oh their youtube channel
blah blah blah
had a look at your link looks like a
series of podcasts that you do
i wish you the best but as most who
follow me know
i do not book podcasts it's great to
have you here bill
thank you it was joy and uh absolutely
you guys
absolutely thank you so much oh thank
you
dude ah to that i responded what's a
podcast
and that was the end to further add to
the confusion because it's fun yes
because there shatner's feed is just him
arguing with people
about tons of stuff that's why i would
think it's probably really him
because what social media handler would
do let's say all the weird nonsense
yeah i mean like hot button political
stuff to
there was like a clickbait article about
how in this new
uh star trek show pike the adventures of
pike and spock
that's allegedly being made by cbs all
access uh
they're going to have kirk on the show
and he's going to be a bisexual
okay and so they're like shatner what do
you think of this like you know kind of
baiting them to say
because would never be gay you know and
they're they're trying to bait and he's
like this was only one
one uh one article on a unreputable
website
if people are just trolling him or he's
trolling them there's a lot of trolling
okay going on okay i guess we mildly
contributed to it uh with the what's a
podcast
response but but that's the only two
times that you've ever talked
shatner right yeah yeah and i never
tried to i mean he doesn't follow us so
i couldn't message him i never tweeted
at him hey
william shatner come on one of our shows
no you can't tweet adam
no and and neither can anyone who ever
recommends red letter media to him
apparently he just starts going on a
blocking spree i i
i actually really like william shatner
well i've been admirer of mike's for a
long time
uh unironically i think he's actually a
really good actor
especially in the original series i
started with the original series
um and and and the original movies kind
of
segued into tng rich and i talk all
about this
in our upcoming video mike and rich talk
about their favorite star trek the next
generation episodes
oh my god it's an exclusive yes it's a
two and a half hours of
talking about star trek the raw footage
the raw footage i haven't edited it yet
but it's coming up
um we might delve into tos um
movies who knows because we're not
talking about new trek anymore
we're done with that you're not going to
talk about upper decks lower depths
probably not oh this is the new shuttle
with the blast shield
then more stuff happened recently and i
don't know what spawned that
it's very hard to dig through this mess
but
shatner doesn't book podcasts or
streaming media
as stated in this response to a tweet
thank you but i don't book podcasts or
streaming media
parenthetical just in case you are
affronted by the term
podcast sorry and i think that's because
everyone in the world started to tell
him that red letter media does not do
podcasts
so when it all started he you know he
kind of glanced over
our site saw that we weren't a major
television network
saw youtube and just said podcasts
and moved on totally fair i do not blame
him one bit
in the initial twitter exchange in
august of 2019 even our friend
macaulay culkin chimed in do you think
he blocked macaulay culkin
probably he said do it bill
it's a lot of fun or something like that
i'm imagining the first video he clicked
on was an episode of the nerd crew
and he thought it was for real
oh god it's sparking oh jesus oh my god
i did not expect this to happen oh god
rich get the toast out it's going to
start a fire
he probably looked uh at the nerd crew
for five seconds and it's like
that's what i won't do yeah stuff like
that
people were trying to explain to him
that we do actual shows right
like review i guess is our most like
legitimate
show where we like talk about a film
that we love there's no goofy skits or
nonsense yeah half of the bag
we have goofy skits uh and then best of
the worst
which is a a drunken rage-fueled
nightmare
so much that it's uh permanently scarred
patent oswalt
so there was there were a slew of
responses mostly defending
us saying that we are a decent youtube
channel with quality content
good reviews some tongue-in-cheek humor
a lot of satire
but the point was made that we can do
decent reviews of stuff
then people were linking him the star
trek the motion picture
review which starts off a little silly
but then jim and i talk about
the movie in detail then if you re-watch
the
entirety of the original series kirk
shatner
he's great i took the proper steps
in the proper order i did exactly what
had to be done
exactly when it should have been done
it's like he knows when to be sober
and when to be focused and when to play
it up and be sort of playful with things
but on top of playing a character he's
also
as a as a leader he's he's also
acting on top of acting because as a
captain
you have to you have to the movie's on
his shoulders to face delete it
so shatner watched the first
60 seconds of the star trek the motion
picture review
here's a quote serious i watched the
first 60 seconds and not only did i find
it offensive
parenthetical especially in the current
culture of things
but the overt product placement when
someone else argued that they make fun
of podcasts that are corporate
shills make it laughable sorry
not for me so to explain that
somebody was telling him that the nerd
crew
is a satire of podcasts that are
chilly for corporate interests like
marvel or
you know major studios although i can't
feel anything right now
because i've been taking gonk zonk a new
antidepressant from pfizer chemicals
made specifically for star wars fans so
when we sat down
to film the episode we
usually have a beer and somebody had
sent us a little six pack
of like federation beer star trek the
next generation beer
courtesy of schmaltz brewing company in
clifton park new york
it's star trek the next generation beer
captain's holiday
but it wasn't product placement but no
and nor have we ever done
product placement right not at once
remember you and i had zombie dust
on the apocalypse uh we're like exactly
what we're drinking wait
like if we like a beer uh we'll we'll
say we're drinking this today
and and we have never received financial
endorsements from anybody
not even the new glarus but we have
never
seen they owe us money by this point
yeah um ten years of shilling for
uh for zero dollars so yes we make fun
of corporate shills because we are not
corporate shills and the the nerd crew
is that
maybe maybe he'll learn a little if he
if bill watches this video maybe he'll
learn a little
but bit about us he's already clicked
off the video he's uh he's already
clicked off
yeah and then somebody said he
he was stupid for thinking we were
shilling
for fake star trek beer because they
should just expect him to understand
everything about
this youtube channel he doesn't know
anything about yes
to which he replied no i'm not a
simpleton
sporto they were plugging federation
beer
which would have been fine but someone
else pointed out they make fun of
podcasters who are corporate shills
so what was that about
plus i wasn't appreciative of the ageist
comments made about sir patrick
well that we can't defend our mocking of
the elderly we can't really
uh come up with an excuse for that my
joke
was was in reference to you know 1980s
patrick stewart
okay i opened my beer the beer
overflowed
oh the beer was called captain's holiday
i think okay which is an episode of tng
where picard is like forced to take a
vacation
and he ends up on a little adventure
with a lady named vosh
and there's some ferengi's and they're
searching for like hidden treasure or
something
um and uh picard falls in love with vosh
uh arkey she steals archaeological
relics and sells them
okay so picard likes archaeology but he
appreciates it
and she's just like a con man who steals
it and sells it for profit
so they got along because they they had
similar interests but
she's a little shady still they fell in
love and they smooched at the end
but the beer was called captain's
holiday and i opened it and it foamed
over and i said looks like captain had a
good holiday
the captain had a good holiday it was an
ejaculate joke
and that's what he thought was an aegis
joke no oh
and then uh i said picard then why did
you explain all that
well i'm setting it up jay humor is
about setting things up
because it has to do with sex and then i
said oh that was the episode with vash
you know
that vash really worked her magic
that was a deep cut
whereas picard calls her
she loves picard's because she's into
artifacts
because her character searches for
artifacts
and the actor you know patrick stewart
at the time was probably a little bit
older than her
it's a quality joke she's into artifacts
that's why she loves books
um do you even get that joke um
and so it wasn't really like an aegis
joke but
that's as far as it got he didn't get to
the other
hour of of dissection and praise of
william shatner's acting and the quality
film that is star trek the motion
picture
so they gave up trying to show them
something real like our video talking
very nice about star trek the motion
picture um and then they started showing
him nerd crew
this is out of control oh no we got to
put the fire on oh my god
i've got a spider-man oh my god it's
spreading oh fuck
then he started posting pictures of me
and making fun of my face
so this is what he wrote so this mic guy
is a huge fan
but not a fanboy and he does a show
where he sits in front of a microphone
with a bunch of star wars stuff
podcast style and makes fun of
people like himself okay
that doesn't sound like eighty percent
of the podcasts out there now
does it
hmm see how is he just trying to fuck
with people is he trolling
or is this an attempt at a like a gotcha
i don't know then you may never know
then there's the picture of me holding
the coffee mug like cross-eyed with my
silly hat on and he wrote
is this a screen grab from the podcast
with effort
because i think people had said they put
a lot of effort into their stuff sure
it looks like a podcast of a star wars
slash marvel
fan
i mean he's kind of right he's kind of
right it does look like that it does
look like that
it's by that's almost like it was by
design
uh and then there's a picture of me from
um
the famous intro with dick the birthday
boy where we're all in halloween
costumes
oh yeah you're wearing a star trek house
and it's like okay i went out to
grab a star trek costume and all they
had was the jj abrams crap
i saw i could find i literally searched
i searched
for a tos era spock costume
could not find one so i had to buy the
the new
zachary quinto version and and then he
wrote whomever this is
even though he's been told this is mike
this is my he likes star trek
this is like would you let him know that
he's wearing a kelvin
timeline tunic not my timeline
the only use of the hashtag not my
timeline so then there was some
controversy over what is and isn't a
podcast
you could consider having the bag review
a podcast because sometimes
i don't but sometimes podcasters have a
camera set up to where they can put it
as a video
yeah mike tyson does that oh yeah he
does he does yeah he has a youtube
channel and he has his podcasts on there
so shatner wrote to that effect really
so the mike tyson podcast i did here
isn't a podcast you want to tell mike
he's wrong and they're talking about
mike tyson
but he doesn't do podcasts i don't know
that that's the story jay
if you were curious and i haven't quite
figured it all out myself
okay i i can totally understand
william shatner's perspective where he's
it's not his world
and people are throwing pictures up of
that's when you just mute everything
mute the conversation
the fact that he's egging people on is
why i think he has to at least
to a certain extent be just kind of
messing around with people you know we
just wanted to throw
it out there uh what happened uh
clear clarify it a little this is our
story
this is our story this is our truth
we're sharing our truth
um we did not ever invite william
shatner to come on any of our shows nor
did we encourage
or engage in people bombarding him with
tweets about
red letter media stuff we had nothing to
do with that
do you remember we went and saw william
shatner live
he took credit for the moon landings he
took credit for the moon landings and
and the show ended with a giant screen
with the
photo montage of of himself and him
sitting on the stage
next to it just looking up and admiring
the photo montage
of himself it's a magical night anyway
that's our little video we did our best
to explain the the william shatner
red letter media twitter fight of which
it was not
a twitter fight we barely had anything
to do with it
our name was besmirched and smeared all
over twitter
and it made it appear as we were
harassing william shatner
we weren't i made a joke about the pet
shop boys
a year ago and this fucking thing is
still going on
william shatner is not coming on any of
our shows
he never will and leave him alone
because i just can't take
captain kirk pulling up pictures of me
on the nerd crusade and calling me a
moron
i just my heart can't take it okay
i've already been through enough star
trek misery over the last three years i
i can't take any more okay
mr spock teleport me up to the star trek
enterprise
and prepare to go to hyperspace
