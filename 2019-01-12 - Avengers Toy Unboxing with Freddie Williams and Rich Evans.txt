hi, I'm rich evans
and I'm freddie williams
and I'm glad you could be here with us today Freddie, because today we are going to do a cool toy unboxing video
cool
I'm excited be doing this with you
yeah I know I know normally this is the kind of thing we make fun of on like the nerd crew
but recently we were contacted by Hasbro and some of the actual press people from Marvel
oh
and they actually sent us the New Avengers end game toy line
oh that's cool
um, sometimes in toy lines they'll show like spoilery stuff for the movie and I hope that's not the case here
because even though I'm an artist for DC Comics I'm really looking forward to Avengers endgame
oh yeah, I'm really excited to see these
you know they they sent us the boxes
the clear implication is they want us to do a toy unboxing video, and I'm not gonna piss off Disney
so
let's get into it
yeah let's see it
doesn't seem to be in a box
but that looks like a Spider Man mask
a black spider-man costume
Oh what they doing the, are they teasing the symbiote
oh
in the New Avengers movie
like a retroactive, uh
and a skateboard
yeah
why does it have swords on it
skateboards
yeah
so I guess
Oh
spider-man's gonna have swords now on a skateboard
what are these
what is this
oven mitts
I mean
they, they don't
oh, they're foot
or socks
they don't have
if they're mittens, they, they don't have thumbholes
it's just a thing you put over your hand
yeah
okay
it says spider-man 3 on it
so
well, this I think this leaves us with a lot of questions
like will the spider-man have a black suit a skateboard
and swords
I don't know, but
yeah
we'll find out more when the movie comes out
now this next box I'm very excited about because I believe this one actually has the new lineup of the Avengers
okay
their action figures
all right
what do we have here
to see if he survives or comes back
okay
so we have the, the new line up to the Avengers
uh
Superman and Batman are now on the team
perfect
and, yeah, we have, like
what is this 
official artwork from the movie
um
it looks like Superman has a web-shooter
and they all are wearing push-up bras
so it really does look like Superman and Batman are gonna be in the Avengers
it says the Avengers
but the packaging is very authentic
all right
all right
I don't know what is in this next one
but we're getting some juicy Avengers endgame details here
my favorite is a Superman with the web-shooter hand
what is this
is that the new lineup
this is, we have some additional details on the new lineup
we have a power ranger
but that's been 10
and, and
oh, that is a Power ranger
and recolored ben 10
mm-hmm
um, yeah
look at superman's head
he looks like, he looks like Jimmy Stewart fell into a taffy-pulling machine headfirst
that's an apt description
I agree with you
it's it's weird to see them all packaged like this but you know with reality bending gems in the Infinity Gauntlet, you can do whatever you want
that's right
with the Infinity Gauntlet, literally anything is possible
just anything anything can and will happen
yeah
in this movie
Ben 10 gets big
i'm excited
I'm excited
Ben 10 gets bigger than all the other characters
what is this
it's the
I don't understand
like so honestly I don't understand the packaging
it looks so official
I don't get this
why is the Hulk on the box
twice
he's not in the package
what is 4 generation
4 generation
the superheroes
a variety of styles
it appears to be made of tissue paper, right
i might be wrong, but i think that's a tissue paper cape
fabric or tissue paper with a spider-man symbol on it
I think it's an external
oh, and there's a Batman symbol on the side
a variety of styles
the children most favorite gift
oh
uh, can i say this
look at that let's check out and see
some more of who's on the Marvel's
Avengers here here we have Marvel
Marvel's The Avengers Batman action
figure look at his face and he's got
like little dots for eyes like he looks
like a mannequin face oh he looks like a
CPR dummy you're gonna crash test dummy
commercials oh yes yeah he looks like
that that's perfect
Iron Man and Captain America and all the
rest I don't this is so confusing okay
here we have the greatest Avenger
Superman it's a clockwork Superman a
clock for Superman in some kind of
robotic costume with a light-up chest
and just the oddest looking ahead
his eyes are intense on that little
figure he looks a little bit yeah a
little bit off but it's I mean it's a
great direction they're going on with
what the costume I mean look how
Superman like he is it's kind of amazing
oh my god okay and then I think we got
one more action figure in here man
clearly with with spider nipples
vitamins huh and with you perfect to
play with oh you put it on the
skateboard though the skateboard you put
them together that's what you get
