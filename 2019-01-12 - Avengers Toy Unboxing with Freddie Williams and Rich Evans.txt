RICH:
Hi, I'm Rich Evans.

FREDDIE:
And I'm Freddie Williams.

RICH:
And I'm glad you could be here with us today Freddie, because today we are going to do a cool toy unboxing video.

FREDDIE:
Cool.
Uh, I'm excited be doing this with you.

RICH:
Yeah I know, I know normally this is the kind of thing we make fun of on, like, The Nerd Crew.
But recently, we were contacted by Hasbro and some of the actual press people from Marvel.

FREDDIE:
Oh.

RICH:
And they actually sent us the new Avengers: Endgame toy line.

FREDDIE:
Oh, that's cool.
Um, sometimes in toy lines, they'll show, like, spoiler-y stuff for the movie, and I hope that's not the case here.
Because even though I'm an artist for DC Comics, I'm really looking forward to Avengers: Endgame.

RICH:
Oh yeah, uh, uh, I'm really excited to see these.
Uh, you know, they, they, they sent us the boxes.
The, the clear implication is they want us to do a toy unboxing video, and I'm not gonna piss off Disney, so...

FREDDIE:
Awesome.

RICH:
Let's get into it.

FREDDIE:
Yeah, let's see it.

RICH:
Well, it doesn't seem to be in a box.
But, uh, that looks like a Spider-Man mask.

FREDDIE:
A black Spider-Man costume.

RICH:
Oh, are they doing the, are they teasing the Symbiote?

FREDDIE:
Oh?

RICH:
In the new Avengers movie?

FREDDIE:
Like a retroactive, uh...

RICH:
And a, a skateboard.

FREDDIE:
Yeah.
Why does it have swords on it?

RICH:
Skateboards has...
Yeah, uh, uh...
So, I guess...

FREDDIE:
Oh.

RICH:
Spider-Man's gonna have swords now on a skateboard?
I, I...

FREDDIE:
What are these?
What is this?

RICH:
Uh, uh, oven mitts?

FREDDIE:
I mean...

RICH:
They...
They don't...

FREDDIE:
Oh, they're foot...
Or, are they socks?

RICH:
They don't have...
If they're mittens, they, they don't have thumbholes.
It's just a thing you put over your hand.
Yeah.

FREDDIE:
Okay.

RICH:
It says Spider-Man 3 on it.
So.
Well, this, I think this leaves us with a lot of questions.
Like, will the Spider-Man have a black suit a skateboard?

FREDDIE:
And swords?

RICH:
I don't know, but...

FREDDIE:
Yeah.

RICH:
We'll find out more when the movie comes out.
Now, um, this next box I'm very excited about because, uh, I believe this one actually has the, the new lineup of The Avengers.

FREDDIE:
Okay.

RICH:
Their action figures.
All right.
What do we have here?

FREDDIE:
Good to see if he survives or comes back.

RICH:
Okay.
So we have the, the new line up to The Avengers.
Uh, uh, Superman and Batman are now on the team.

FREDDIE:
Perfect.

RICH:
And, yeah, we, we have, we have official artwork from the movie.

FREDDIE:
What is this?

RICH:
Um, it looks like Superman has a web-shooter.

FREDDIE:
And they all are wearing push-up bras.
So, it really does look like Superman and Batman are gonna be in, in The Avengers.

RICH:
I mean, it says The Avengers.

FREDDIE:
But the packaging is very authentic.

RICH:
All right.
All right.
I don't know what is in this next one.
But we're getting some juicy Avengers: Endgame details here.

FREDDIE:
My favorite is a Superman with the web-shooter hand.
What is this?

MIKE:
Is that the new lineup?

RICH:
This is, we have some additional details on the new lineup.
We have a Power Ranger.

FREDDIE:
No, that's Ben 10.

RICH:
And, and...

FREDDIE:
Oh, that is a Power Ranger.

RICH:
And recolored Ben 10.

FREDDIE:
Mm-hmm.
Uhm, yeah.
Look at Superman's head!

RICH:
He looks like, he looks like Jimmy Stewart fell into a taffy-pulling machine, headfirst.

FREDDIE:
That's an apt description.
I agree with you.
It's, it's weird to see them all packaged like this.
But, you know, with reality bending gems in the Infinity Gauntlet, you can do whatever you want.

RICH:
That's right.
With the Infinity Gauntlet, literally anything is possible.
Just anything, anything can and will happen...

FREDDIE:
Yeah.

RICH:
...in this movie.

FREDDIE:
Ben 10 gets big.

RICH:
I'm excited.
I'm excited.

FREDDIE:
Ben 10 gets bigger than all the other characters.

RICH:
It's on the back, yeah.

FREDDIE:
What is this?

RICH:
It's the...

FREDDIE:
I don't understand.

RICH:
Why is the...

FREDDIE:
Like, so honestly, I don't understand the packaging.
It looks so official.
I don't get this.

RICH:
Why, why is the Hulk on the box?

FREDDIE:
Twice.

RICH:
He's not in the package.

FREDDIE:
What is "4 Generation"?

RICH:
"4 Generation."
"The Superheroes."
"A variety of Styles."
It, it, it appears to be actually made of tissue paper, right?
I might be wrong, but I think that's a tissue paper cape.

FREDDIE:
Fabric, or tissue paper with a Spider-Man symbol on it?

RICH:
I, I think it's an external.

FREDDIE:
Oh, and there's a Batman symbol on the side.

RICH:
"A Variety"...
"A Variety of Styles."
"The children most favorite gift."


FREDDIE:
Uh, this is, can I see this, please?

RICH:
Yeah, you go ahead and take a look at that.
Let's check out and see some more of who's on The Marvel's Avengers.

FREDDIE:
Okay.

RICH:
Um, here, here we have, uh, Marvel, Marvel's The Avengers, uh, Batman action figure.

FREDDIE:
Look at his face!

RICH:
Oh, my god!
He looks freakish!

FREDDIE:
And he's got like little dots for eyes, like...

RICH:
He looks like a mannequin face.

FREDDIE:
Oh, he looks like, um, a CPR dummy.

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.
Do you remember the crash test dummy commercials?

FREDDIE:
Oh, yes.

RICH:
Yeah, he looks like them.
That's what his face looks like.

FREDDIE:
Perfect.

RICH:
And here we...

FREDDIE:
And he's on the packaging!

RICH:
He's on the packaging.

FREDDIE:
What is this?

RICH:
He's hanging out with Iron Man and Captain America and all the rest.

FREDDIE:
I don't, this is so confusing.

RICH:
Okay.
Here we have the greatest Avenger.
Uh, Superman.

FREDDIE:
It's a clockwork Superman.

RICH:
A clockwork Superman in some kind of robot costume with a light-up chest.
And just the, the oddest-looking head.

FREDDIE:
His eyes are intense on that little figure.

RICH:
He just looks a little bit off.

FREDDIE:
Yeah.
A little bit off.
But it's, I mean, it's a great direction they're going on with what the costume.
I mean, look how Superman-like he is.

RICH:
It's kind of amazing.

FREDDIE:
Wait, what is this?

RICH:
Oh, my god!
Okay, and then I think we got one more action figure in here.
And that's, that's Spider-Man, clearly with, with spider nipples.
Spider nipples and a spider belly button.
Here you, here you go.
Your Spider-Man toy with your Spider-Man oven mitts.

FREDDIE:
Perfect to play with!

RICH:
Oh, you can put him on the skateboard!
Where is the skateboard?

FREDDIE:
You put 'em together.
That's what you get.

RICH:
All right.
Well, that was our 100% legitimate, uh, Hasbro, uh, Avengers: Endgame toy unboxing video.
And, uh, I thought it was great.

FREDDIE:
Yeah.
Awesome stuff.
It was great just to get an early peek at it.

RICH:
See what's upcoming in the new movie.

FREDDIE:
Aughhh!
