Hello, I'm Mike Stoklasa.
You might remember me from such videos as Natural Disasters and You, Bear Hugs: How to Be Prepared, and Lifelong Goals: What's the Point?
But today, I'm here to tell you about some amazing new products, which are available now from Red Letter Media.
Wow, all this looks amazing.
That's right, Susan.
But in addition to these amazing new products, we have the Red Letter Media t-shirts back in stock, as well as brand new Lightning Fast VCR Repair shirts.
Wow, my mom's been waiting for that.
You may not be cool enough to work for Lightning Fast VCR Repair, but now you can pretend that you are are.
Are those pint glasses I see?
That's right.
They are, Susan.
And we also have very small pint glasses, too.
Keep filling it up.
It's not at the top yet.
Keep filling it higher with booze.
It's not there yet.
Keep pouring idiot.
It's not filled up yet.
Keep going.
There's more wrong in the pint glass.
And if you need to open up your drinks, we have the newly-designed Half in the Bag bottle opener.
Works on all drink sizes!
Or you could stick it up your ass.
Wow, all this shit is fucking amazing.
I can't wait to tell my friends, family, and clergy.
That's fucking right.
And if you call within the next ten seconds, we'll send you this free autographed Rich Evans photo.
Operators are standing by.
What?
You heard it, too?
I heard someone say, "Hail Satan, kill them all."
