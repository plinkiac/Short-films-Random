Okay.
We're rolling right now.
Rich, where are we?
Yes, we are in the lobby of The Oriental, waiting to see The Room.
What was your favorite scene in The Room?
Uh...
What stands out the most--
The scene where Denny had deal with his substance abuse issues stands out to me as a favorite.
That was very dramatic.
Oh, my god.
Don't worry.
You're manhandling me.
Yes.
I'm manhandling you.
Okay.
And...
We tried to get him to say "You're tearing me apart, George Lucas."
Yeah.
But he wasn't, he wasn't having it.
"You are tearing me apart, George Lucas."
George Lucas?
He said he knew the real George Lucas.
Why George Lucas?
I know the guy.
He asked me if I knew him, too, and I said, "Yeah."
And then, and then I butted in, and I said, "It's a different George Lucas. It's unrelated to the Star Wars."
And he--
He still wasn't having it.
He was not believing us.
He compromised.
Go.
"You are tearing me apart, George!"
"You are tearing me apart, George!"
"You are tearing me apart, George!"
To Rich.
"To Rich, may all of your--"
I can't make that out.
Dream.
"...may all of your dreams come true."
There you go.
Thank you very much, sir.
