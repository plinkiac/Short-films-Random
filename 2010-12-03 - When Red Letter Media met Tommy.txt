JAY:
It's, it's rolling already.

MIKE:
We're rolling right now. It's cool. Rich, where are we?

RICH:
Yes, we are in the lobby of The Oriental, waiting to see The Room.

MIKE:
What was your favorite scene in The Room?

RICH:
Uh...

MIKE:
What stands out the most?

RICH:
The scene where Denny had deal with his substance abuse issues stands out to me as a favorite. That was very dramatic.

JAY:
Oh, my god!

TOMMY WISEAU:
Don't worry.

JAY:
You're manhandling me!

TOMMY WISEAU:
Yes. I'm manhandling you. That's a good title.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
And...we tried to get him to say "You're tearing me apart, George Lucas."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But he wasn't, he wasn't having it.

JESSI:
"You are tearing me apart, George Lucas."

TOMMY WISEAU:
George Lucas?

MIKE:
He, he said he knew the real George Lucas.

TOMMY WISEAU:
Why George Lucas? I know the guy!

JESSI:
He asked me if I knew him, too, and I said, "Yeah."

MIKE:
And then, and then I, I butted in, and I said, "It's a different George Lucas. It's unrelated to the Star Wars." And he was...

JAY:
He still wasn't having it.

MIKE:
He was not believing us. He compromised.

JAY:
Go!

TOMMY WISEAU:
You are tearing me apart, George! You are tearing me apart, George! You are tearing me apart, George!

MIKE:
To Rich.

RICH:
"To Rich, may all of your..." I can't make that out.

TOMMY WISEAU:
"Dream."

RICH:
"May all of your dreams come true."

TOMMY WISEAU:
There you go.

RICH:
Thank you very much, sir.
