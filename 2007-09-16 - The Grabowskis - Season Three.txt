[Intro]

CLIFF:
Hi, Honey. I'm home!

HONEY:
Hi, dear. Here's your pizza!

CLIFF:
That's all you made for me, is the fucking goddamn pizza?

HONEY:
No! No, Cliff, no! Oh, god!

[Episode #1]

HONEY:
Grabowski's residence.

CLIFF:
Right, enough with the small talk. Look, Honey, Sammy's head is caught in the storm drain.

HONEY:
Oh, my gosh! Call the fire department!

CLIFF:
Listen very carefully, stupid. His head is caught in the storm drain. He's not on fucking fire, you moron!

HONEY:
All right, where are you at? I'll be right there.

CLIFF:
Top of the morning to you, officer!

HONEY:
Cliff!

CLIFF:
Yeah?

HONEY:
Cliff, where's the baby?

CLIFF:
The what?

HONEY:
The baby!

CLIFF:
He's right there. He's in the storm drain.

HONEY:
Oh, god. We've gotta call somebody. We've gotta do something before it...rains.

CLIFF:
Honey, we can't call anybody. Remember what the state said. One more child-related "incident", and they're gonna take away our welfare checks. Which means...

HONEY:
That means I won't get my cigarettes or my pain pills for free anymore!

CLIFF:
It also means I'm gonna have to go back to work! Who's gonna sit on their ass all day and watch The Munsters? I provide an important service to the television industry.

HONEY:
You know what, for the first time in my life, I think I agree with you.

CLIFF:
Hmm.

HONEY:
What are we gonna do?

CLIFF:
We strip all his clothes off. We leave him here. No one has to know he was our baby. They'll think it was a stray that got his head caught here.

HONEY:
What about the DNA?

CLIFF:
We scrape it off.

HONEY:
That won't work.

CLIFF:
Why not?

HONEY:
DNA's in the liver...right?

CLIFF:
I dunno.

HONEY:
I don't remember. You know what, I'll look on the web, I'll check my Blackberry.

CLIFF:
I'll bluetooth it. 411, hello?

HONEY:
How do you work this again?

CLIFF:
Hello? Where is the DNA?

HONEY:
I'm not getting anything.

CLIFF:
Where is the DNA in a baby?

BOTH:
iPhone.

HONEY:
Oh. Okay!

CLIFF:
What do you got?

HONEY:
Okay, uh, Web MD...

CLIFF:
Yeah.

HONEY:
...says that, uh, DNA is, uh, everywhere!

CLIFF:
What would Herman Munster do?

HONEY:
Die of pancreatic cancer?

CLIFF:
No, `no. He would cut Sammy's head off. He would take it down to the basement laboratory, and Grandpa Munster would reattach it.

HONEY:
Cliff, that's crazy. We don't have a laboratory or a Grandpa Munster!

CLIFF:
Wait. I know what we should do. We cut Sammy's head off. We take it down to a basement laboratory, where Grandpa Munster...oh. He freed himself!

HONEY:
We are such good parents.

[Episode #2]

WOMAN:
Really? I've never tried hot wax before. It sounds erotic!

HONEY:
It really is. And you know what, you should get to know the candlestick maker, because he is so good. Oh, great. Cliff's home.

CLIFF:
Here, start making dinner. We're having a guest tonight.

HONEY:
Really? Who?

CLIFF:
Frank Hammer. He was on the east side. He's never over there. I had to invite him here. I had to settle the score.

WOMAN:
Who's Frank Hammer?

HONEY:
Only Cliff's arch-nemesis, and the only man to survive getting punched in the face by Cliff and not getting knocked out immediately.

FRANK:
So, Cliff. 

CLIFF:
Yeah.

FRANK:
How's that wife of yours, what's-her-name?

CLIFF:
Honey.

FRANK:
Honey. I bet her pussy is a sweet ass, eh Cliff?

CLIFF:
I'm sorry. What did you say?

FRANK:
I'm saying that I'd like a slice of that sweet Honey pie. Metaphorically speaking, of course.

CLIFF:
Mm-hmm.

FRANK:
You know, Cliff, if you were to ever die, or even to be slightly injured, I'd be over there fucking that little princess faster than you could say...I'm saying that if she's the Honey, I could be the king bee. And that little Honey would get some of my king bee honey! You know, some of my metaphorical Honey all over her face and boobs. Ha ha ha ha ha! All hail the king bee! A-buzz! A-buzz!

CLIFF:
How many times have I told you, there's no such thing as a fuckingking bee!

FRANK:
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

CLIFF:
It was more than just not getting knocked out. The man didn't even flinch. Now I've punched out men, statues, horses, women, even dinosaurs. But not Frank Hammer. He's like the Lois Lane to my Superman.

WOMAN:
Don't you mean kryptonite to your Superman?

CLIFF:
No, no. I don't mean that at all.

FRANK:
Cliff. You said there'd be dinner. Well, looks like I'll be eating out.

CLIFF:
Yep, still got it! That was all me. All me, still got it, yep.

WOMAN:
Fuck you.

[Episode #3]

CLIFF:
Hello, Honey.

HONEY:
Hi.

CLIFF:
I'd like you to start taking one of these pills every morning.

HONEY:
Cliff, I already take a multi-vitamin.

CLIFF:
No, it's not a multi-vitamin. It's a morning after pill. I just wanna be certain.

HONEY:
But Cliff, we barely have sex. And when we do, I usually wake up right in the middle of it and shove you off of me, so I don't think you have anything to worry about.

CLIFF:
Honey, it's not for me. It's for the others. I've been talking to some of those guy that wait at the AIDS clinic, and they've told me where you've been at night. You've been going to those speed-dating things. And I know you, Honey. You have sex before the first date. So, what am I to do?

HONEY:
Yeah, but won't those make me sick?

CLIFF:
Yeah. No. Absolutely yes, no, no. Probably not.

HONEY:
All right, honestly, I think I should talk to my doctor first.

CLIFF:
Well, that, that is perfect, because I am your doctor now.

HONEY:
What?

CLIFF:
Yep, got my degree six minutes ago online. Yep. Nurse!

NURSE:
Here's the form. I need you to sign here, here, here, and here.

HONEY
Okay. Well, you know what, maybe this is a good thing that you're a doctor now, Cliff, because you really should be looking at Sammy.

CLIFF:
Thank you, nurse.

HONEY:
He has this huge tumor on his head.

CLIFF:
Yeah, let me take a look.

HONEY:
Sammy, no!

CLIFF:
He'll be fine. Now, back to you. Nurse, 10 cc's sodium pentothal.

NURSE:
Yes, Dr. Grabowski.

HONEY:
A truth serum?

CLIFF:
Yeah.

HONEY:
Cliff, you really just wanna know how much I've been sleeping around. This is what it's all about, isn't it?

CLIFF:
Thank you, nurse. Absolutely not. Now, this will probably hurt a lot.

HONEY:
Whoa, wait a minute. I want a second opinion.

NURSE:
You're ugly, too!

CLIFF:
Nurse, that's not funny.

HONEY:
No, seriously. I do not accept the fact that you're an actual doctor.

CLIFF:
Dammit, man. There's no time!

HONEY:
I am an alien from the planet Dragnor. I have come in the form of a human female in order to procreate with human males. I take the conceived embryos and transport them to my spaceship in outer space via a matter energy transportation device where they are bred as a warrior race to take over your planet.

CLIFF:
Yep! Everything's normal.

[Episode #4]

HONEY:
So everything was all right for you guys? You don't need any change? No? All right, well thanks for coming to Wings n' Things, and have a great day. Bye!

BRIAN:
Ken, she's perfect.

KEN:
I dunno, Brian.

HONEY:
Oh, guys, guys, wait. Hi, um, if you get sick, I need you to take this card, call the number on it...sometimes the pigeons we trap on the roof have E. coli in them. Just wanna watch out for you, okay? All right, have a great day, bye! Thank you! Come back again! Not too soon.

BRIAN:
She's got pizzazz, spunk, energy. She's just what we're looking for. Excuse me, miss?

HONEY:
There's a wait for table, you fucking asshole!

BRIAN:
No, we have a table. I'd like to ask you if you've done any "acting"?

HONEY:
Look, after I had my kid, I retired from all that DP, hoof-and-mouth, squirting and fisting porno. If you're looking for a cum dumpster, just go down to Water Street. Or you could call my sister.

KEN:
I think I'm gonna be sick.

BRIAN:
No, we're from the corporate offices of Wings n' Things, and we're looking for a real life employee to appear in our next television commercial. And we think that you could be in that commercial!

HONEY:
Oh! Honey, I'm home!

CLIFF:
Sammy, what is it that you're reading, Sammy?

HONEY:
I have fabulous news!

CLIFF:
You're a hologram, and I can turn you off?

HONEY:
No. I'm gonna be in the new Wings n' Things commercial! I'm gonna be on TV!

CLIFF:
You know, Sammy, ever since your mother left me, life's been nothing but downhill. Look out, look out! The fucking bird's back! The bird's burning my eyes! Sammy, the bird got loose! Well, at least I still got my new wife.

HOLO-WIFE PROJECTOR:
Cliff, I want sex. And then, you know what I'm gonna do, I wanna give you a big fat juicy steak.

CLIFF:
Dammit! Cheap ass holo-wife projector! Made in Korea garbage. Oh. I think I fixed it. 

HOLO-NURSE PROJECTOR:
Hi, Mr. Grabowski. It's time for your enema!

CLIFF:
Not another enema. All right. Let's get this over with. So when are they filming this "commercial"?

HONEY:
Uh, 45 minutes from now.

CLIFF:
I think I'd like to come around...to support you.

HONEY:
Really? Okay. But don't forget the snake.

CLIFF:
Okay.

KEN:
And, action!

HONEY:
So, for the best-tasting wings in the state of Wisconsin, try Wings n' Things! Now with three times less E. coli!

KEN:
Uh, cut. Honey, that was really good. Only, it's "three times more flavor"...

HONEY:
Oh, right. I'm so sorry.

KEN:
...not E. coli.

HONEY:
I keep messing that up. I'm so sorry.

KEN:
That's all right, it's all right. You're doing so good, you're so good.

HONEY:
Okay.

KEN:
Let's take it again.

HONEY:
All right.

BRIAN:
Oh, can I help you, sir?

CLIFF:
Hi. I'm Ms. Grabowski's husband. I'm Cliff Grabowski.

BRIAN:
Oh, nice to meet you, sir. You've got a really nice wife there. She's, she's really talented. She's really going places.

CLIFF:
Yeah.

BRIAN:
You know, I was talking to this old Jew who produces Hollywood pictures.

CLIFF:
Uh-huh.

BRIAN:
And he was saying that she would be perfect for one of the next movies of his.

CLIFF:
Oh, really?

KEN:
You know, Brian, uh, interesting fact is, uh, I read it in Variety magazine, 98% of actresses divorce their husbands.

CLIFF:
Well, I'll, I'll let you guys get back to work. I'll, I'll see you later.

KEN:
And, uh, Honey, let's do another take. Action!

HONEY:
So, for the best-tasting steak in the state of Wisconsin, try Wings n' Things, with 33% more E. coli!

KEN:
Cut!

CLIFF:
How's it going?

KEN:
Uh, good.

CLIFF:
Holy shit! What's that over there? t's Bigfoot! Are you guys getting this on film?

BRAK:
I'm getting it! I'm getting it!

KEN:
Brak, focus! Wait, no, don't do that!

CLIFF:
How many times can you see Bigfoot?

KEN:
You're wasting film!

CLIFF:
Well, that's the end of that.

HONEY:
My one chance at stardom ruined by a big, dumb, hairy apeman.

CLIFF:
Actually, Honey, Bigfoot is a graceful, intelligent creature.

HONEY:
I was talking about you.

CLIFF:
Who needs Hollywood anyways, Honey?

HONEY:
I did! I thought I did! I dunno. I was really upset when you sabotaged my potential stardom at first, but, I dunno, maybe you did it because you want to keep me around. Because deep in that black little heart of yours, you love me, Cliff Grabowski.

CLIFF:
Yeah, that's it.

HONEY:
So, uh, tell me one thing.

CLIFF:
Yeah.

HONEY:
Who did you get to dress in that ape costume?

CLIFF:
Costume? I really went out and got Bigfoot!

HONEY:
Oh, Cliff. You're so silly. Oh, my god. You really did get Bigfoot!
