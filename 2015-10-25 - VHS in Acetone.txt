SCIENTIST MAN:
Hello, I'm Scientist Man. And in today's experiment, we have a jar, The Jar, and a jar of acetone. "What is acetone?" you ask. Well, let me answer that q-..."acetone, systematically named pro-, propanone, is the organic compound with the formula C-something-CH-3-20...is a colorless volatile flammable liquid. Acetone is misc-, miscible with water and serves as an important solvent in its own right. Typically for cleaning purposes in a laboratory. Mainly used as a solvent in theproduction of methyl-, methacrylate and bis- a, bisphenol A. It is a solvent produced...a common building block in organic chemistry...familiar household uses of acetone. It is the ingredient in nail polish remover and paint thinner. It's in many, some synthetic fibrids. Let's begin the experiment. Oh. Let's begin...oh. Next, we'll take our acetone. Remember, always wear safety gogglies and rubbly gloves. I am now going to put the acetone in the jar with The Jar. Ugh. Oh, geez. I spilled it all over the table. Remember to pour it carefully, as its currently eating away my glove. I just splashed it all over my crotch. God, it [REDACTED] stinks. That seems to be enough acetone. I am now going to place the lid on the jar. Oh, [REDACTED] me! It's a good thing this isn't highly flammable. Nothing but a fraud. I'm gonna go wash off my crotch. It's getting all over my shoes. Shit's fucking...I shouldn't have dropped out of scientist school. Ow, there's burning in my eyes. I think I've got something...oh! [REDACTED]!

THE JAR:
I, I, I, I, I, I, I....I, I, I consume the lifeless moments of shadows. I consume the lifeless moments of shadows. The flickering seconds of memories. I stand on the edge of darkness. I am the night. Black. Dark. Cold. Silent. I see that when I see it.
