um it's like Felicia or Kristen or
something I'll have to take a multiple choice on this one
hurry Julie
do you know I do I didn't know until the multiple choice though okay oh okay
Julie yes yes because I hear that little kid saying Julie yeah and then when
she's flinging on the ceiling Ollie yells to that whole movie is Julie
and Rex yeah from her baby in nightmare in Elm Street
five the dream child oh Jacob yes
why was it you're so hesitant say yes yeah it's got to find it I gotta look in the back and make sure because I don't
know the [ __ ] answers print is really small that's true that's why he's got his peepers on yeah I need my peepers
I'm a [ __ ] 45 year old man I gotta get some more two-point questions to get to it Mike
in the beginning of Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge what was the
kid sitting behind Jesse on the bus holding
uh uh uh maybe like would be like something Freddie related oh yeah give me the multiple choice God damn it
a stereo a lunch box Freddy's hat
Freddy's claw I was gonna say Freddy's hat it wouldn't be the claw I would say the Hat it's a stereo everyone knows you
get no points you didn't even get the multiple choice right I had to guess because I didn't know that he Jay's
getting the easy questions I'm getting the hard ones this is not correct I think they go they go increasingly
harder on each card okay well why don't you just like randomize things but now he knows that like he's going to give
you the harder questions and be the easier ones why did they do that because there's dice I think you're
supposed to roll for the difficulty do we want to use the dice we have nowhere to roll them on
all right we're changing up the rules here for maximum randomization uh the game does come with dice and there's
there's bodies dead bodies on each side and I think they coincide with the
difficulty of the question so like if you roll a five then you re question five
so for maximum uh so we're not just going from easiest to hardest on each car right we're gonna we're gonna shake
it up is it my turn I think it is my turn yeah yeah one
I'm real good so sorry I have a real good feeling when I'm in a role
what classic movie was spoof during the opening scenes of Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare
Wizard of Oz that's the moment you know you're in trouble with that film I'll
get you my pretty and yours
yes I got a one oh okay one I gotta let me get a new card I got a new card now
when does this game end s we'll see Mitch will just see
first first uh again two points a question let's say first if
20 80. well it's like okay uh you wanna do 40
Jay's already Jay's already at 10. okay Jay's already at 10.
let's just keep going we'll decide later okay Mike yeah who was the dream master
Kristen Alice what Alice is the dream master is it
dream master three oh there's three Warriors Three Warriors is a group of people you think you've got what it
takes one
style is loaded in Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare what did Maggie use in Her Dream to see
into Freddy's mind uh 3D glasses yes
that's also when you know that movie's in trouble all right I got a three all right in Wes Craven's New Nightmare
who was Freddie's last victim uh
well there is no Freddy in New Nightmare like if that's really like because I'm
gonna get technical hold on give me a second there is an answer and it is a name okay okay
um she goes down into the basement with
uh her son into the into the into the into the
underworld oh yeah yeah the underworld um you said based on a scene of the first movie they're in their actual
basement he doesn't kill John Saxon right
oh I'm gonna say it's probably the babysitter um Julie Craig yes
because yeah they go right from the hospital back to the house a little kid runs through traffic remember and then friends Scoops them up
make sure your point give me two points I've already gotten you two points all right one
he's not shaking Richie's just dropping the die
[ __ ] cheater Jay what were the last words spoken in
Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare yeah correct
damn it oh I got a one hey in Wes Craven's New
Nightmare can you leave Wes Craven's New Nightmare alone I'm sorry just remember that this is not Freddy's Dead this is
chosen by the die can we Shuffle these [ __ ] cards
in Wes Craven's New Nightmare what did Chase design for the new a
nightmare and a robotic Freddy glove yes take that [ __ ]
look at this look at how much I'm shaking it up here see that I do
yes he got a four four okay Jay what was the body count in Wes
Craven's New Nightmare does that include people in dream like
is the opening is a dream sequence that doesn't count it just that's the question that's all I
got for you no but those guys eventually died that's true they do so two
the husband three the babysitter Julie's for
I think that's it I think it's just four correct hey
in Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare who was Freddy's last victim
didn't we just have this question no that was the other movie you will forever get those two movies confused
won't you is it the hearing aid guy I don't know who this is
oh who's the girl the um does she die no she lives there's the daughter
and then I think the girl is in the basement with them and so that leaves
um 90s video game kid and I'm gonna get it right if I say 90s video game kid I don't remember his name okay
you might but I have no way of knowing Jay will know Jay will confirm there's nine news video game kid and then
there's hearing aid guy and I think hearing aid guy dies earlier I'm gonna say 90s video game kid Jay who is 90s
video game kid I don't remember his name but he's not the last to die in that movie what's the answer Rich it's gonna
be John John oh John Doe dies the last yeah well I
lost that guy got the [ __ ] question wrong can you pick him from the middle Rich so
we don't get Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare and New Nightmare and everything I don't think I think it's random it's pretty random by the way you
got a five Jay got a five I got a five okay at the beginning of nightmare in Elm
Street for the dream master this is my favorite one that I've seen a hundred times how many kids were playing outside
of Freddy's house during Kristen's nightmare in Nightmare on Street four uh four I
think just one five five that's where the little girl strong but um there's the two the jump
rope girl two girls holding the jump rope there's the chalk girl and then there's a little boy oh
okay I think you got a chance to three in Wes Craven's New Nightmare
what was the name of Dylan's toy dinosaur
I gotta take the multiple choice I'll give I'll know what just out of
Mercy I'll give you a hit it's a very obvious name all he yells for that whole movie is Julie and Rex yeah Rex
Barney no but that won't count that I'll give you the multiple choice okay a Barney
be rap C Dino and D Rex
Rex Rex yeah I remember I'll give you one point for that two two
what did Freddy Krueger's mother change her name to when she entered the Covent
changed it to I need the multiple choice okay uh
Sister Mary Margaret Sister Mary Helena sister Peter Marie
Sister Mary Teresa I think it's Sister Mary Margaret
Sister Mary Helena oh
lay on the lay on delay what's the score uh Jay has 16 and you have nine
kind of bad oh four four in Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's
Revenge what did Lisa tell Jesse that his dreams could be
Daddy's gay no something is trying to get inside my body is that your answer
I'll take the multiple choice nightmares drug trips

oh [ __ ] five yeah in Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge what was the name of
the bar where Jesse ran into coach Schneider oh do you know this no
that's a tough one I want to say the blue oyster bar but that's the gay bar from the police academy movies
I'll take multiple choice Don's place Don's Tavern Dan's Bar and Grill
or Dickie's place I was like this place
I think the bar and grill sounds right I'm gonna say that one Don's place that
place definitely wasn't a bar and grill well I thought I remember thinking so maybe I was just I was saying less
Bar and Grill is a euphemism or something two two
how did Freddie's wife die oh yeah well three people said something what
was three I know it was a joke she got choked he strangled her okay
Freddy killed her oh okay what you got a five five the odds are
stacked against me and I'm rolling them terribly in Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's
Revenge what was printed on Lisa's dad's apron during the pool party well typical
thing would be like Kiss the chef or something like that but I'm gonna have to go multiple choice can cook
Chef dead of the Year Mr Wonderful oh Mr Wonderful
such an odd answer that it could be that I'm going to go with that you gotta yes hey that's the
rule of trivia that I learned from the Beast yeah is always go with the weird answer one if you're not sure
are you rolling that I I you did it I just look at this do you want me to do you want me to give you
five sure give me five I'm changing the rules wait that's a new rule
double the points if you if you pick a harder like question so double the
double points if I get it right without using yeah that's a lot of extra points
you can one extras it only applies to me
you know what I'm gonna say that's let's do that okay the rule will be that if
yeah we can just do my kids double points no no we got to keep this Fair we got to keep it fair as much as Jay's
kicking your ass Mike go ahead Jake I'm still gonna beat him normal points normal points but you
rolled a one points but I'll be happy to read you number five no give him the one he rolled the one in Nightmare on Elm
Street three Dream Warriors what was the name of the dream suppressant Nancy took
hypnosil yep that one I knew that one
two in nightmare I'm straight 2 Freddy's Revenge how many years had passed since
Nancy lived in Jesse's house five or ten

the dream master who died in his waterbed uh Joey damn it I was hoping you
wouldn't remember correct uh oh oh oh oh true or false
Nancy survived through the end of Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors false correct

oh Spencer's a video game kid yeah drugs oh no can I change it before you answer
it Mike you're already you know what I'm not gonna let you because you're already ahead by a lot okay but you won't get
the points but if you want to just try for fun okay I I said drugs because he's like a druggie but they find a pipe bomb yes yeah but no points that's that's

oh it was Kincaid like working out I think he was working out and then he went in his room I'm gonna say that no
it's not even one of the multiple choices give me the multiple choice then you already answered
um Jay do you want to have mercy and let him get to the multiple choice well he's sitting on his bed and he's like singing
a little song yeah I think he's like throwing his baseball at the wall yeah well what is the actual answer
uh you know I'll do it for the multiple choice okay I don't know if I'll give Mike the pointer not we'll leave that up
to to UJ to decide but the options are reading comics watching MTV throwing
darts or playing video games oh this is Joey I was thinking of Kincaid he said Kincaid is it says Kincaid yeah could
Cade's throwing darts oh okay I picture him like throwing a baseball at the wall for something should I give Mike no no
no no no I didn't remember it I knew he was just laying on his bed and he's just yeah he's throwing darts I just picture
him laying on his bed and his dog is with him but I didn't really it's so simple yeah it wasn't anything major
yeah okay I legitimately got that wrong five

Parker born oh God uh multiple choice
all right uh 1967 1969
1972 1976 72 67

yeah punching you pricked correct yes you give me two points I gave you two
points I gotta make sure that too uh in Nightmare on Elm Street 4 the dream

uh MTV correct it's that guy yeah whoever that guy was that had the one thing missing out of his glasses yeah
four according to Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare in what year did the courts take Freddy's daughter away well
I can't just randomly guess a year so I'm gonna have to take multiple choice 1963 1966 1971 1977.
71. D6 uh for the record here score is Jay has
31 and Mike has uh 19.
five yes in Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge at what time did Lisa's dad want
to want the party to end midnight no oh 10 o'clock 12 30. 12 30
minutes no later 12 30. nice time
I'm sorry you didn't get that right three in Nightmare on Elm Street 4 the dream
master what did the little girl building a sand castle in Kristen's dream say her
name was oh um it's the same as Kristen no wait wait
wait wait wait she what's your name
Alice what's your name she either says Alice or Kristen and
Kristen she comments on it and says like Kristen that's my name or Alice that's
my friend's name I have a friend named Alice um and I can't remember which one it is
what's your name Alice weird Alice Prince yes
oh my God three Alice I have a friend named Alice that's it and then the girl Giggles yeah and
then Freddy puts on his sunglasses no he's a shark fins come out in the water scenery
okay all right Jay I'm ready to give it your points which a nightmare an Elm Street actor
had a cameo in Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare as the star of an anti-drug commercial oh that's Johnny Depp yes I'm
so pathetic when it comes to knowing what movies I've done I'm sorry I I just
I don't watch them yeah I got a four in Wes Craven's New Nightmare
what was Heather's husband's name not not Reese
that's that's uh that's Terminator that's yeah Kyle Reese um
I'll take multiple choices for the easy one one point Chase Porter is Chase
yeah now since you only read one does that count as a one and a quarter point
quarter points Mike Nightmare on Elm Street three Dream Warriors what did Freddie utter while
killing Taryn oh yeah
uh what a rush yes what a rush
ah darn it five yeah who's saying The Nightmare on Elm Street
for the dream master theme song oh I think that's um that's Tuesday
night yes I cut that I mentioned that in a review and then they cut it out because you said I don't care so I'm
surprised you remembered I remembered yeah you got me two points for that you got you got your two you got your two three
what was the body count in Freddy's Dead the Final Nightmare didn't we already do this I think it was
a different movie it was who was the last person oh okay okay it was John Doe so we got John Doe
we got Carlos the hearing aid kid the video game kid
does his wife count his wife that's a good question because that's a
flashback he doesn't Freddie doesn't it just says what's the body count she says what's the body count I would say the flesh back doesn't count
it should but I'm gonna say I'm with these cards it probably doesn't so I'm going to say three you are correct Jay okay
these cards are wrong because his wife dies we see or die in the movies
that's true I might have reminded him about them yes he almost talked himself out of the right answer but you helped
him Mike that was so generous go to hell two two
in Nightmare on Elm Street 4 the dream master who was afraid of bugs
oh um workout girl her name was
oh I have to take a one pointer for this really yeah I don't remember her name
Debbie Sheila Rick Ellis it's not Rick because
that's not a female's name she Sheila oh what was the first one Debbie Debbie
she loves Debbie Rick Ellis Felix the asthmatic girl Alice is of course the
main uh Debbie correct five in Nightmare on Elm Street four the
dream master what was written on Sheila's sheet of paper
oh uh this is right before he sucks her her
insides out learning is fun with Freddy correct hey
and then for no reason a robot hand comes out of the desk damn it
five damn it means five I'm confirming I guess I could have metaphor you could
have read a four and I've been happy with the four yes okay ready
I'm gonna I'm just gonna know what you know what Mike every question's gonna be a five everything you're gonna say
read the damn question in West Craven I gotta bust the catch in Wes Craven's New
Nightmare I don't know it who played Chase Porter I don't know
okay I have a 25 chance of guessing correctly so give me the multiple choice please David Newsome
Cody Frederickson Bodie Elfman Matt Winston
the last one I know one of those Now isn't it was the first one oh
can you say that with a little less contempt for me [ __ ] you uh two in night run Elm Street 2
Freddy's Revenge who played Jesse's mother Cheryl Walsh
I know who played the dad usually you know actors I don't know this I know clue goo here's the dad uh I need the
multiple choice Priscilla pointer hope Lynch Sally Field Patricia Arquette
hope Lange yeah okay you roll out the last two I hope it's that name's on a yeah
yes yes all right number five what what dammit
all right true or false A Nightmare on Elm Street was the first
feature film produced by new line Cinema oh that's probably true because that's
what kicked them off right unless they had like a really low budget junk thing before that but I'm going to say
I'm going to say true correct so Jay now has 40. and Mike you have
25 27. okay that's not bad 13 13 Point difference we're playing to 700. okay
we're gonna keep watching we're literally just gonna keep playing until Mike wins we're gonna keep moving the goal posts okay until I get ahead then
we stop you see how this works because I absolutely have to win
this silly game show that we created one he has to stop rolling once that's
the first one I've rolled in a while I think I think you just need to play a different game with Jay can we play Star Trek trivia we did a video about that
remember you need to play a game where rolling ones is really bad okay change the rules play Dungeons and
Dragons with Jay you'll have a great time all right all right sorry kid I don't believe in very case
uh one true or false the producers of a nightmare in Elm Street originally
wanted an unbilled stunt man to play Freddy Krueger that's true for the first one yes
I'm gonna say that's false true really yes that was the case with the second
movie they didn't want to pay Robert England so they hired us though I heard that about the first one I know they
wanted David Warner that's that was proven to be a myth some at least according to the internet oh yeah that's
the first time that it was like a urban legend that wasn't actually true you look into that I would have to yeah
what one all right true or false Friday the 13th producer Sean Cunningham
directed a short A Nightmare on Elm Street Scene when director Wes Craven
was pressed for time
that's how oddly specific I know it is I'm going to say it true correct
you got me two points on that I'm getting writing them down right now Mike uh three just don't trust him I I don't
blame you in a Nightmare on Elm Street 5 the dream child which teenager was the first to die
Dan Dan is correct Dan Dan
thank you damn it which company was nicknamed the house that Freddy built
new line Cinema correct
that was easy for Five Points yes it was I think we're wrong about the difficulty well oh I think that's been pretty
consistent that's probably a weird question if you get randomly and you don't know anything about like the movie business we know more about the videos
and stuff yeah uh four in a Nightmare on Elm Street 5 the dream child which
position did Dan play for his high school football team oh God I need multiple choice on that
one quarterback wide receiver tight end halfback
I want to say tight end wrong this wasn't the gay one
he was quarterback okay one true or false I don't like this
I hate this one too The Nightmare on Elm Street home video was banned in Finland
again so oddly specific I have to say true true yeah okay Finland interesting
board other than Freddie who did Robert Englund play in nightmare in Elm Street
4 the dream master feeling better now a nurse
yes although technically the nurse is Freddie yeah but yeah it's him out of
makeup so that's true what true or false
this is apparently a lot of the ones which were false the name Krueger was based on the
character Krug from Wes Craven's film The Last House on the Left
sure okay you got it they're all true now so that's the
pattern yeah I'm happy getting this true or false questions fine all right all right that's my
chance we're just gonna keep playing until you get ahead
in Nightmare on Elm Street 5 the dream child what year did Ellis and Dan
graduate high school movie came out in 89
so I'm going to say 89 correct a second is either that or the movie was
shot in 88 so it was 88. two in Nightmare on Elm Street five the
dream child which career did Greta's Greta's mother push her to pursue
uh being the model correct yes to go gnash my teeth for the paparazzi
Rod oh I was gonna say but seriously how what are we playing up to you yeah 50.
nice even around 50. that sounds good because you're almost there yeah I'm like 40 something I don't really need to
win I'm just playing that for the cameras everybody 50 is fun okay Jay you have 10 20 30 46 46. oh oh wow
okay yeah let's make it a hundred thing what do I have uh 10 20 30.
seven
um oh I had rolled a five in Nightmare on Elm Street 5 the dream child what was written on the lollipop that Mark and
Greta shared after their graduation
remember the lollipop I don't remember anything being written on it uh multiple choice I guess kiss me lick me love me
hug me I'm gonna guess kiss me
[ __ ] lollipop well I know that but he's he's like in love with her he was in love with her and he's being pervy
yeah so harassing her yeah so I assume it'd be something more like kiss me here
yes too or false actor Kane Hodder was once considered
for the role of Freddy Krueger
false correct yes you know what Kane Hunter is right he
played Jason yeah he would be too big for Freddie two uh true or false John Saxon auditioned for
the role of Freddy Krueger in a Nightmare on Elm Street false correct
damn it in Nightmare on Elm Street 5 the dream child when Freddie became a super
villain in Mark's dream what appeared on his chest
oh I'm super funny um
naturally one would think like a like some something violent I want to say it was like a like a lightning bolt kind of
like how Shazam looks I don't know why
I I want to talk about that I'm gonna take the multiple choice you sure you don't want to go with that I'm gonna go with that okay did I get it
right it's a lightning bolt yes see Rich really is my friend I guess
thank you I'm starting to feel unfair I appreciate that rich uh five
in a Nightmare on Elm Street whose picture sat on Lieutenant Donald Thompson's desk
uh Nancy's correct for in a Nightmare on Elm Street how
many jump roping children were on the screen the first time I'll read that again because I think I
read that a little bit awkward I I got it I think it's probably three in that very first one
it's four oh oh my bad I would have said three I think there's three at the end maybe I
don't know five which a nightmare and Elm Street film was the biggest box office hit
four yep yeah Jay you have you have 52. oh
okay oh okay so so that that means the end of regulation game well for well
because you know for the sake of the even number of questions we'll we'll do one for you and this is worth
the same mud points and then we'll do the Jeopardy I rolled a two in Nightmare and Elm Street 4 the dream
master who played Kristen Parker this will be Tuesday night yes
you have 43 Jay has 52. okay and then closer than I thought
yeah this is uh now this is final final Freddy yep final Freddie uh where I am
going give me the tray here's how we're gonna do this I am going to roll a die to pick the
question and then Jeopardy style I guess you both need pieces of paper you're going to have a wager of your points and
then you're going to write down your answer okay we could write it down on the text function on our telephone that's true that's true okay look at me
I'm getting all into the future let's let's do your I guess Jeopardy first video your wager first we do our wager
before we know how hard the question is yeah sure okay yeah yeah yeah you you you oh you what what you have to do also
uh like Jeopardy as you what you wager is private until the end yeah so okay
I'll enter my wager what is he doing he's blocking his
Vision shout out to see her phone serious business okay
my wager has been entered um my wager has been entered and then below that we put our type the answer
yeah okay okay we're just rolling the die no five does that mean each of us have
to answer a five question for both same questions oh yeah okay haven't you ever seen Jeopardy I got it I got it
thank you in a Nightmare on Elm Street what was
the number of the police precinct where Rod was locked up
this is [ __ ]
can we do multiple choices no no this is [ __ ]
read the question again please sir in A Nightmare on Elm Street
what was the number of the police precinct where Rod was locked up
like this something yeah all right uh well Jay you're ahead so
what did you well in a way they usually do this in lowest on Jeopardy yeah what did you put down I said the fifth Precinct how much did
you wager I wagered all of it you've got all of it Mike are you kidding me it's
the precinct you [ __ ] you just won the games are you kidding me no I'm not it's the
fifth it's the fifth that's amazing Jay what did you guess I wagered all of it and I
I put 13 because I thought maybe it'd be a John Carpenter reference I just I thought like what and if I'm writing the
movie like fifth Precinct I just thought of that Precinct Five I don't know I just has a
you can double check if you want it's no I believe you it's fit I believe you
I have one friend of Jeopardy versus Jane not a blind guest all because of one
question well it wasn't a total blind guess it was like like a um like you were
thinking like a screen I was thinking like yeah what would I write in a script that sounds easy to say the fifth
Precinct station you know 13th it's too obvious like
I was going to say sixth but I went with fifth I don't know why maybe I remembered it somewhere deep down in my
rotting brain you you somehow Mike you did it you did it you you kept this game going
and changed the rules until you won that was a pretty darn good win though that I
mean I'm surprised myself I totally didn't have no idea and I was just kind
of using some kind of logic to guess something I pulled it off well now we start round two where we
play Friday the 13th trivia
moving on to Friday the 13th trivia how soon after Friday the 13th Part three
did Friday the 13th Part 4 the Final Chapter take place
seven years one year you're both wrong it's the same night in Friday the 13th
Part Two what was the name of Terry's dog
Mr Wolfie spot Kane it was muffin
Kane would be a good guess because I'd be like an inside joke although Kane Hodder wasn't involved in the franchise at that point
but you tried true or false false true you're somehow
both incorrect
