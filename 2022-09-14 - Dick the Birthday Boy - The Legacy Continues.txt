You make it sound like something amazing is about to happen it's only mildly amazing.

MIKE:
Okay, well...

RICH:
Mild, something, am-, mildly amazing.

MIKE:
People are turning off the video now. It's very amazing. This is the original photograph. Um, unfortunately, I had put a pin hole through it at some point.

RICH:
Ehh, whatever.

MIKE:
Which was which was unwise. But yes, this is really Rich. The Dick the Birthday Boy shirt has become a meme on the internet. The, the, we've, we've discussed, the picture has appeared on The Ellen Show.

JULIA:
I'm sorry, but I cannot take my eyes off Dick the Birthday Boy.

ELLEN:
Yep.

JULIA:
Honestly, who said that's a great idea?

ELLEN:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
Um, t-shirts have been made.

RICH:
You know, Ellen's career took a dive shortly after she used that photo. I just want to point that out that this photo might be cursed.

MIKE:
I, I, I, well...

RICH:
I mean, look at me.
it is
it is on the cursed images website so
awkward family photos i mean it's
everywhere
um but it is you
and we can guarantee that
yes
what's the story behind the photo rich
why don't you start
i mean the story is i was a small child
and i was given that shirt to wear on my
birthday that's the story
uh i made the shirt i've was it nanu
hold on let me tell the [ __ ] stories
god damn it mike
why are you grilling me i'm gonna
[ __ ] tell you
i i was actually curious about this i i
went to visit my uncle
uh somewhat recently a little while ago
now but i asked him like what what's
deal with that damn shirt who's whose
idea was the shirt he didn't remember no
no he actually he he thinks he does
uh he it was just my grandmother's idea
to get a shirt that says dick the bird
date boy she was completely oblivious to
any
alternate meaning that it might have to
punctuation the punctuation thomas was
not a factor she just wanted to have a
birthday boy shirt for her beloved
grandson that's your shirt and you wore
that shirt on your sixth birthday i
don't know but you look about six i
could be six five maybe you went to
showbiz pizza wore the shirt
all of the birthdays for the family were
they were always at that showbiz pizza
right i mean i'm sure they're long
clothes they probably became a chuck e
cheese at some point the showbiz pizzas
are gone um
they were they were in chicago
chicagoland area they are a thing of the
past now
but they live on in meme form
yeah or the the bear does at least yeah
what's the bear's name jay billy bob
billy bob of course would you ask him
what do you ask him for i don't know i
figure because he remembers stupid
things
i thought you would say i don't know why
do you think i know that
billy bob the banjo playing bear who
leads the
rock of fire explosion
i stand corrected
this is this was every from night from
my childhood every single one of my
birthdays my sister's birthdays and my
my brother's birthdays
mine too not every single one but i did
sit in the king's chair
you remember the king's chair i don't
think mine had a king's chair yeah i
didn't get a kinkster yeah the the the
head of the table you got the king's
chair it was your birthday your [ __ ]
royalty now jeez
no
i was invited to the queen's funeral but
i declined
anyways
so
uh
flash forward
45 years
uh nanu
has died
your beloved grandmother who you grew up
with yeah
uh who's who was the star of many of our
short films and you know the house stung
so bad i just thought i'd take a trip
and i went to the art institute and come
to the statue of david
and i don't know what happened i touched
i was just kind of touching his hair and
everything all of a sudden the whole
statue fell over i can't move
and and and i run because i grabbed
something i thought it was his hand or
so i didn't know what it was and and it
was it was
it was his dick you know when i put in
my purse like i don't know what to do
can they arrest me for that is there a
cry for stealing david sticks i don't
know honey i don't know honey you have a
very strange fascination with
not only
my childhood but specifically that woman
am i being interviewed here
am i on trial
who wouldn't have a fascination with
nanu she was strange as [ __ ] i think you
should be on trial because you did steal
my my my family photos well okay
rich
is tearing up his grandmother's
very gaudy home
to
uh
to get rid of to sell it because uh you
weren't gonna live there anymore
nanu was in a grave
and it was time to sell the house she
had died i was i was in my early
twenties and um
i was just ready for the next phase of
my adult life and i wanted to
i didn't give a [ __ ] about the past i
just wanted to leave that [ __ ] all
behind me
and i had taken those photos it was
family photos
i think i just tossed them in the dab
trash you did you did and like a filthy
garbage picker
you came along and snatched them up i i
am i am uh
i'm uh
a man of a visual medium i'm i'm uh i'm
a filmmaker i'm an artist
you're you're you're what you are i'm a
garbage picker and i saw those pictures
on top of a pile of trash and a garbage
can and i thought why is he throwing
away family photos i looked at them
and i instantly recognized the one
that's the funniest is you pose
next to the showbiz pizza bear
here's my question for you but here's my
question for you all right
what was your motivation was your
motivation you know you're my my you're
my oldest friend mike since since high
school to this day you're my oldest
friend
did you see those photos in that trash
and you thought man i know richard evans
is in a bad place right now but he's
making a huge mistake i'm going to save
his family photos or did you take a look
at that dick the birthday photo and you
said god damn that rich evans is a weird
[ __ ] i'm saving this so i could laugh
at this for years to come and someday
someday i will exploit this image of my
friend and embarrass him on national
television on the ellen show um well
i think the latter is a little uh
far-fetched
to be honest you might not believe me
but my real reaction was
why is rich throwing away pictures
of his childhood
uh uh
honest to god yeah uh and then i thought
wow this one's pretty funny
because i thought it was funny and i put
them in my pocket
and i kept them
and i kept them
for and this is where the new revelation
comes comes from right yeah because i
completely forgot
the next part of the story i kept those
pictures and i remember seeing them i
remember having them
and then all of a sudden
i couldn't find them
yeah
and so it turns out when it came time
for your actual birthday when we filmed
the best of the worst episode the
halloween episode
where we surprised you with the dick the
birthday boy t-shirt that photograph
remained hidden from since the day i
found it until the day i presented it to
you
did you like steal my old family
photographs is there like an album of
mine in your possession
this is creepy
it's not like i was showing it to you
every no the other week you know that
that that really completely took me by
surprise right i didn't even i had no
recollection of that shirt
i do not remember my childhood sure i
wouldn't no one would remember their
fifth birthday so
uh you're yeah we showed you the shirt
first i think and you're like what yeah
i didn't get it at all and then we
showed you the photo and that's the
first time you saw the dick the birthday
boy photo and i had the other photos and
i think
it was off camera i said here rich
here's the rest of them
keep your pictures well there's some
mystery behind this because i don't
really remember you i don't remember you
giving those photos back to me
i don't remember
they just kind of vanished i remember a
conversation a few years ago
you're just saying yeah those photos are
somewhere i can't find them
and they were just they were just
missing a whole stack of family photos
what happened was
my sister came to visit me about a week
ago and she was going through some of
her old family photos and she brought
her album over and we're going through
those and i'm like you know i think i
got some old family photos somewhere and
i dug out
my photo books what the stuff i do i
apparently didn't throw everything out i
had like three little photo albums
and
those photos that you stole
were were
stuffed in one of those albums can we
not use the word stole can we use the
word saved okay
those photos that you had lovingly saved
to laugh at your best friend
that turned up inside a pile of [ __ ] i
had in my closet
and there there were
fresh brand new
dick the birthday boy photos so that's
that's the uh purpose of this video
uh is that
after
uh ten years now
since that best of the worst episode i
don't even [ __ ] know damn near it was
like the first that was the first
halloween episode a long time ago we
have found the missing photos from the
dick the birthday boy
birthday party
um
and we will present them to you
very soon
after the sad break
i bet that pizza tastes good
you've never seen a place like show this
pizza place will serve you
so rich whatever you choose to believe
um
i'm telling you with with all truth uh i
did not take the photos from the garbage
that day
because i had a grand scheme that
20 years from now
that would become an internet meme
that would appear on the ellen show i
was just right i was just in uh
spencer's gifts which was at the mall
and i went in there and i saw that shirt
i'm like oh what the [ __ ]
yeah it feels a little bit skeefy
that's
yeah yeah the little lawyers didn't ask
you to speak unless huh our lawyers said
don't speak on this yeah okay
so you have no comment i
i have no comment okay at this time
i i've seen this i have no comment at
this time i have no comment at this time
okay great
no i'm sure it's surreal seeing the dick
the birthday boy shirt and spencer's
gifts uh
yeah for those of you who don't know
many people have been telling us about
this you can stop now because we know
it is it is cons it would be considered
nano's intellectual property and even
though she is deceased
it would pass on um
for for a hundred and something years
according to copyright law yeah
um
but we would have to look into this into
this matter i have no comment at this
time i have no comment at this time okay
great we should also point out that we
sell that shirt
so anyway that's the story that's the
legacy of the dick the birthday boy
photo
a handful of photos i stole from a
garbage can
saved
for 15 years
only to surprise you one day
with a reunion of the photos to which
you had no memory
uh then but much amusement was had by
all and then for the photos to disappear
i always thought i had them and when you
said where are the other photos i said
in a special place
but
i was lying
because i couldn't find them
i thought i had threw them out for real
it's you know i i honestly don't
remember how they got them back in my
possession i don't remember i don't
remember
it's possible
it's possible
that you left them around the studio
and i stole them back so you couldn't
further torment me that's possible
maybe
the photos then were lost
for another 10 years
only to resurface again so so we have
discovered the missing outtake photos
from the dick the birthday boy
uh birthday party which is now a thing
of legend
and uh we're gonna go take a look at
those photos now yeah let's let's go
take a look all right
okay you ready yeah okay let's take a
look here they are right here you can
see the showbiz pizza bear in the
background creeping towards you and you
can see how how ridiculous that ball
paper is look look at the presents g.i
joe
yeah i was big into the giant village
ewok village again is that ewok village
you're still wearing the dick the
birthday boy shirt what is this this
that looks like a very cheap pinball
machine like a oh it's a pinball machine
like the kind you bought at kmart that
was child-sized made out of cheap
plastic oh wow right here we see
a carded what looks like a quique
oh yeah yeah you're still wearing the
dick the birthday boy shirt what is this
we are going to frame them
hang them on the wall
in a private area
of the rlm headquarters
you may have noticed
we've blurred all the photos in the
video
ones like this
you will never
ever
see these photographs where they're only
to be seen by us or any special guests
that we might have
unless you're a celebrity like
i i i don't know maybe someone like
patrick stewart wants to come over and
see the famous stick the birthday boy
photo william shatner he's always well
william shatner's not welcome here ever
harrison ford oh harrison ford mark
hamill mark campbell that'd be fun as
welcome as a guest to view the pictures
and in the private collection
but they will never exist in a digital
form
uh the the actual master master tapes
from this interview
after the video is posted will be
destroyed
i'm not kidding
and the the only
actual images will will be on polaroid
as they were meant to be
seen with the human eye and
when when a guest views them
they'll be monitored very carefully
as to make sure they don't take a
picture with their cell phone
that they're not wearing like those
google glasses with the camera in them
uh or anything like that uh so that's
that uh here's the pictures again take a
look enjoy them
or you know try to enjoy them but i
really can't because there's just
blurred but we made this video to tell
the world that we found them
uh they're real you can make out the
powder blue in the blur okay sure yeah
yeah so you can see you know you could
get that much
watch she's gonna it's spencer's gift
this is gonna be a dick the birthday boy
shirt but the words are just blurred
the
blurred image of a polaroid will become
a meme next
there's nothing we could do
there's nothing we can do
dick the blurth stay boy
