do you think it might have been a scam
it's unfortunate that all the money that
was supposed to go to my charity
vanished that's why i'm back to play for

go with a charity that wasn't quite so
controversial which is why the charity
i've selected today is the harvey
weinstein legal defense fund help get
harvey out of prison well i'm here to
hopefully help my charity pay off some
of the debt it owes this show
from last time

embarrassing jay i'm so sorry sadly
though i think your charity will end up
owing a lot more money after today's
show cause i've brought my a-game and i

lynch foundation headquarters in new
york los angeles and fairfield iowa is
that that weird meditation thing yeah
i'd rather give money to a con artist
all right let's play
jay yeah who killed laura palmer uh
leland palmer i will accept that
bob oh that's that was the other was it
bob in the persona of leland palmer yes
although it does get tricky when you get
to firewall
you know i always wanted to go on a
[ __ ] tangent on star trek trivia and
i did
all right so that's one knowledge point
to jay there
all right mike
what does mr jackpots yell when he
gambles oh my god
oh my god um yes yes
it's your favorite thing uh
oh god why can't i remember it it's my
favorite thing from the thing
hello
hello
that's correct mike one point to you
mike uh i got a bonus question for that
this is a little tougher one this is
open to both of you uh from which mr
show actor does he learn that
catchphrase
mike bob odenkirk incorrect shay it's

uh
uh the highest level of scout which is

god
i don't even know he was in the boy
scouts i thought you were talking about
the last boy scout with uh bruce willis
wow that movie i was like he was in that
movie and i was sorry no that was called
the last boy scout so but he was an
actual boy scout he was so he was an
eagle i figured a man who has a career
as a filmmaker you know has commitment

level of eagle scout i'm using deduction

holland drive

i'm going to put half of mark producer
okay producers give you a half a point
for that one producer overrides the host
i agree with the producer
can we get a different host jesus no
one that will give me all the correct
answers
when they'll ask me about star trek
that'll ask me about star trek i tried
that there were some nicely taylor made
questions for me yeah what was the name
of david lynch's beloved jack russell
terrier featured in the opening scene of
blue velvet
jay sparky correct are you [ __ ]
serious i'm dead serious
that was a complete guess oh my god yeah
it's sparky it's sparky yeah here we can
oh my god visual aid we can cut two
maybe it was like subconsciously in your
brain maybe because you know david lynch
is interested in electricity that's what
that was kind of well i was just
thinking sparky's like a generic dog
name yeah it's a standard old-fashioned
dog name what television show features a
character named philip gerard and a
one-armed man
mike uh the fugitive correct
what does it have to do with david lynch
uh because in twin peaks there's a
one-armed man and a character named
philip gerard ah
look at that a little general knowledge
helping me out here another correct
answer would have been twin peaks then
right
uh
yes yeah
did you get that point too clever for
that ah
man
all right we're we're starting to wrap
it up here folks we only got a few
questions left how are you feeling about
how everything's been going let's just
check in with you here you know i
haven't been keeping track of score but
i feel like i'm doing pretty good i feel
like i'm doing better than i expected
and i feel like jay is doing
much worse than i expected
i hope david lynch himself is watching
this video i guarantee you he's not
can you can you picture him watching a
little youtube video on his [ __ ]
phone what is this [ __ ]
a bunch of neck beards talking about my
stuff
give me a damn cappuccino get real
all right few more questions here
tonight and then we're almost done thank
god
whose agent dropped them after seeing
blue velvet
mike
kyle mclaughlin incorrect
jay
uh isabella rosalini yes
apparently uh not into it she was she
was uh consulting roger ebert but he
asked isabella rossellini in this movie
to be undressed and humiliated on the
screen as few actresses ever have been
certainly in non-porno roles why won't
harold smith leave his house
yes jay because he's got that phobia
witch phobia is it agoraphobia correct
points extra points for knowing
the root word meaning of agoraphobia
agora
it comes from outside i think either
greek or latin but an agora
is an outdoor marketplace that's crowded
with people oh i'd be scared of that too
yeah so i thought it was the type of
sweaters that ed would like to wear
that's angora
but an agora was was an outdoor
marketplace that was crowded with people
so that's where the word comes from
not a
agoraphobia but agoraphobia right
because all the words come from either
greek or latin
oh my that's worth 35 points
only a few questions left to bring it
home jay all right get ready get ready
all right i haven't been able to guess
the black lodge one time this whole
[ __ ] show that's true can i just
guess it yeah the black lodge incorrect
but you guessed it and so good job
all right so we're ending around with a
little speed around here you buzz in on
this one uh you will match the diner to
the film or the show david lynch uh
notoriously big fan of diners
and so there are a lot of them
throughout his filmography i'm going to
name a diner you're going to buzz in and
tell me if you can
tell me which film or show
the diner's from orma is mentioned in
okay the double r diner
jay twin peace that's the only one i
[ __ ] know
maybe you should have buzzed in a little
quicker
and then you would have gotten the point
i needed to hear the full name of it you
knew it from double
the double diner
winkies
uh blue velvet incorrect pops
mike blue velvet no arlene's
uh lost highway blue velvet no kidding
no
god damn it come on man
no god
you can't just keep guessing blue velvet
apparently you could have i guess i
could have yeah son of a kid simon's
with a z
the diamonds mike lost highway nope j
nope twin peaks
that was twin peaks how many diners are
in twin peaks [ __ ] lot all of them it
takes place in a small town i don't know
that's the coffee shop where uh cooper
goes get the pie at the end
oh jesus all right paps
haps
jay lost highway no
mike
okay no fire walk with me oh i wouldn't
i guess that all right and finally eat
at judy's
twin peaks yeah i'm sorry that wasn't uh
quite the last one there's a bonus
question here that's going to be
impossible the lamplighter in
mike
uh does spider walk with me no twin
peaks
before you walk with me is twin peaks no
but it's not from it's the struggle with
me i figure lamplighter fire
it's the place that cooper goes um on
the way into town for the first time i
don't need the explanation all right
i i was trying to make some kind of
logical deduction
that's not always going to work this is
david lynch that's true that's very true
sorry
and that's the end of the show that's
our quizzes are all wrapped up that's
all the questions i have let's go to the
producers for our final score
the final score how
who did how many did they both get
oh oh i i stopped keeping track ages ago
oh i think mike was up 2-1 oh
surprise win for mike
we only answered three questions but i
won i thought it was a ratio it doesn't
matter it's a win it doesn't sound right
but i won good good job mike and jay
yeah
you know you you competed well you
worked hard
um seemed like you got a lot of those
questions right i don't know but i think
that's the fault of the producers yeah
well
it seemed like it was more than
i'd like to thank our riders and our
producers here and
uh tune in next time
if this happens again
i'd like to demand a recount
uh that's within your rights producers
can we do a recount there
where you on the account yeah
the points you wrote down
right right now did you write them down
no
oh i'm just doodling
what'd you draw i draw a little cap
okay yeah
yeah
does this mean i owe the show more money
no you owe david lynch money
so i wish i could uh congratulate mike
but he's gone
i think i heard him drive off yeah
he was my ride oh
i thought i had this one
oh
hello
i need a ride home
