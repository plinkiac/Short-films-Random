MIKE:
Hey, Rich.

RICH:
Hey, Mike.

MIKE:
We're here to do our first and last Let's Play video.
Today, we're going to play a video game.

RICH:
Why, why the fuck are we playing a video game?
You've never played a video game in your life, Mike.

MIKE:
Sure I have.

RICH:
You played one Star Trek game when you were a teenager.

MIKE:
Shut up.
And I figure, you play the game because you know how to play a video game with a keyboard and a mouse, which is completely foreign and weird to me.
But you don't know what game we're playing today.

RICH:
No.

MIKE:
It's a complete surprise to you because you live under a rock.

RICH:
Oh, my god!

MIKE:
What a neat little intro.
Your cursor is a little VHS tape.

RICH:
Is this something official that happened, and nobody told me about it?
What is this?
What is this?
"Fade in."
"Interior Wisconsin warehouse."
"Late evening."
"Player, age unknown."
"Hot but doesn't know it."
"Steps forward."
"Player."
"Cool, normal."
"Guys said they'd be out, uh, pitching to Nolan."
"Guess I got the place to myself."
Wind-driven snow twists outside the warehouse walls."
"Overhead, the A/C hums."
"Cozy."
"The floor is well kept, but a handful of props asked for closer attention."

MIKE:
Oh...

RICH:
"Well, these VHS tapes aren't gonna inspect themselves."
Cut to...
Oh, my god!

MIKE:
Oh, ho!
It's so clean.
I think we gotta find VHS tapes and inspect them, Rich.

RICH:
What is the, what is the story behind this?

MIKE:
I don't know.
Pick up a tape.

RICH:
How do I...

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh.

RICH:
What are the controls?

MIKE:
"e"/"square".

RICH:
Okay, okay.

MIKE:
What does that mean?
Inspect.
Oh, okay.

JAY:
Now hit "e" again.

RICH:
Oh, my gosh.
It's even got the little bottom, uh, rainbow-colored info thing.
"A variety hour-type TV special about various activities of Chewbacca's family during Life Day."
"It aired only one time and was met with instant and extreme disapproval."
"So naturally you can watch some of it on Plinkett's TV."
I'm using up, like, I'm using up my own control set up at home.
I don't, like, I use a keyboard, but I got, like, a weird little mousepad thing.
So this is a little bit different for me.
But I can, I can...

MIKE:
Too much information.
Inspect.

RICH:
Is that...
It's New Glarus.
I was gonna check.
They got New Glarus.
"A cask-conditioned farmhouse ale, 4.8% abv, and only available locally."
"The New Glarus Brewing Company was founded in New Glarus, Wisconsin in 1993."
Oh, my god.
Oh, we gotta check out Rem Lazar.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
"One of the three entries and the Best of the Worst hall of fame, along with Surviving Edge Weapons and Cameron Mitchell."
"The writer/director Scott Zakarin would go on to invent a web series as a concept, wh-, the web series as a concept in 1995, and lead actor Jack Mulcahy would eventually star in a Snickers commercial."

MIKE:
Creating Rem Lazar, coming out on Blu-ray soon.

RICH:
Shoji, of course.
Big Hunks.

MIKE:
California Big Hunks.

RICH:
Uh, which one is that?

MIKE:
Uh...

RICH:
Why don't we find out?

MIKE:
Geritol Follies.

RICH:
Geritol Follies!
"This whole tape is on YouTube if you like."
"It seems like elderly people, uh, doing singing and light comedy, which is fine."
"'I expected more from amateur elderly people.'"
"Jay Bauman."
Kid Sand Airbags.
"Ah, airbags."
"Truly, safety equipment from a more civilized age."
"There is no reason not to provide them for kids."
"I don't know who this is for, or why."

MIKE:
I...
Oh!
Nice shot!

RICH:
Oh, this is all wrong.

MIKE:
This is wrong, but that's okay.

RICH:
This is wrong.
You, you failed!
You failed!
But that's okay.

MIKE:
That's fine.
It's fine.

JAY:
I think he was taking artistic liberty.

MIKE:
It's artistic liberty because the Best of the Worst set that we pull out the green curtain, and behind it is the red curtain.
With, uh, with the thing.
For those of you who don't know, but that's okay.

RICH:
"Come back when you found all the tapes."

MIKE:
That's why I brought this out.

RICH:
Oh, my god.
Now we have to find all the tapes.
Now we have to find all of the tapes.

MIKE:
Look!
Your, your, your, uh, your hatchamacallits are up on the wall.

RICH:
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
The, the PreRec?

MIKE:
Your, uh, your 8-bit graphics.

RICH:
"Loyal footsoldiers of the Bowser regime, and the second most common enemy Mario faces."
"Koopas can sometimes lose their shells in gameplay, a fact not true of any world spec-, real world species of turtle."

MIKE:
Look.
Ev-, every paint.
In-, inconsistency and, and mistake is on there.
How is that, is that scanned in?

RICH:
They gotta have, like, taken a still image from the backdrop.

MIKE:
And just turned it into a 3-D?

RICH:
Turned it into a 3-D.

MIKE:
Is that what a 3-D printer is?

RICH:
Now, now another, another fun thing.
Uh, you see the back of this?
They have, this is just blank?

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
I actually painted the backs in an alternate color scheme.
So you got, like, the nighttime underground Koopa on the reverse.

MIKE:
The, the inverse, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's Colin!
On the box!

RICH:
All right.
Should I keep reading everything?

MIKE:
"Colin would later develop severe osteoporosis."
"Dance-based therapies."
"He continues rapping to this day."
Tums!
Uh-oh...

RICH:
What?

MIKE:
Why are you throwing the Tums?

RICH:
I'm trying to, uh, I'm hitting the wrong key.
I mean to see what it says.
I'm messing up.
"Ultra strength Tums contains 33% more acid fighting power per tablet, compared to extra strength."
"Relieves pain associated with heartburn, indigestion, and being terribly wrong on the internet."

MIKE:
You remember when you were wrong about Tums?

RICH:
I remember when I was wrong.
Oh, it went, it went behind the re:View set. 

MIKE:
Acetone!

RICH:
"A compound with the formula C (Something) CH3..."
I can't read it.
Oh, there.
"CH-twenah."
"Acetone is a colorless, highly volatile, flammable liquid, mainly used to dissolve VHS copies of The Jar."
"Remember!"
"Always wear: 1) Safety gogglies, and 2) Rubber gluvs."

MIKE:
"Rubbly gluvs!"

RICH:
"Rubbly gluvs!"

JAY:
"Safety gogglies and rubber gluvs!"

RICH:
"See also: Giant flask."

MIKE:
Ooh, that's...

RICH:
I threw that terribly.
The, the throw and the drop key are...

MIKE:
Yeah!

RICH:
Right next to each other.
What do we got?

MIKE:
There's 2 of 50 found.

RICH:
2 of 50.

MIKE:
Cheap beer.
The original fake beer.

RICH:
Oh, yeah!

MIKE:
Ah!
Ah!
Kid Sand Air...

RICH:
Kid Sand Airbags.

MIKE:
Wait!

RICH:
No.

MIKE:
You're almost there.

RICH:
No!
No!
It's Geritol Follies!

MIKE:
The Rem Lazar landed on Geritol Follies.

RICH:
All right.
I'm gonna make sure I find all the ones I found before.
Just so we're not confuse-ed.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
You can play Jenga.
Rich.
Pick a tape to remove from the Jenga pile.
Oh!

RICH:
Oh, no!

MIKE:
No, no!
You fucked the Jenga pile up.

RICH:
I fucked the Jenga pile up.

MIKE:
The city dump.
This is a classic wheel.
S.O.S.!

RICH:
S.O.S.!
I'm assuming it does that every time.

MIKE:
The "whah-whah" losing horn?

RICH:
"Whah-whah-whah..."

MIKE:
Uh-oh.
How to Have Cybersex on the Internet.

RICH:
Yeah.
S.O.S.
Surviving Edged Weapons.
Which one was that?
That was, that was The Osteoporosis Dance.
You gotta have that.

MIKE:
Oh, these are all the classics.

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That's what they're gonna use.
That makes perfect sense.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
What are the boxes?

RICH:
Pizza rolls.

MIKE:
Totino's.
Pizza Rolls.
Of course.
Okay.

RICH:
I think there might be tapes...
Yeah, there's a tape...

JAY:
Yeah, you can see 'em.
You don't have to duck over them.

MIKE:
Space Cop.

RICH:
Space Cop.
On VHS!

MIKE:
What does Space Cop say?
"This is RLM's 6th feature film, and it literally took 12 years to make."
"Unfairly considered intentionally bad, the film is more of a straight-forward comedy in the style of the group, and people should lay off it."
"Movies are hard, man."
Well, that's fair.

RICH:
Movies are hard, man.
Though, really, considering the amount of shit we give everything...

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Just, just lay into Space Cop.
Just lay into Space Cop.
Just lay right into it.
It's fine.
Fuck Space Cop.
What was that cat from?
What was that...

JAY:
I think it's from the, the David Lynch trivia video.
You were, like, drawing it off camera when you were...

RICH:
Was...

JAY:
When you were keeping score.

RICH:
Oh, right.
I drew a cat.
I drawed a cat.

MIKE:
"Folding chable."

RICH:
Folding...

MIKE:
"Fix, fix the..."

RICH:
"Folding chable."
God.
"To-do: fix whopper button."
"More commentary tracks."
"Keep hittin' those homeruns!"
"Faster, more intense reboot?"
Neat.

MIKE:
Look at the detail on the table.
It's, it's pretty accuarate.

RICH:
That's pretty good.
It's pretty good!

MIKE:
I mean, it's darn good.
For...

RICH:
For somebody who didn't actually come in and inspect it and scan it and look at it.

MIKE:
What does the, what does that say?
"They make flasks this big and you can just buy one, no one can stop you and it's not even illegal."
"Appears in Best of the Worst: Future War, The Jar, and White Fire."
Yeah, yeah.
I remember that.
Space Cop headquarters. 
Oh!
Dangit, that's fragile, Rich!

RICH:
It's fine.

MIKE:
"Ring atop..."
Yeah.
Uh-oh.

RICH:
Oh, no.

MIKE:
Rich, you know what to do.
Get that tape!

RICH:
Oh, that's Shakma.

MIKE:
What's that?

RICH:
Wait, wait.

MIKE:

Yeah.
Can you go through that door?
Yeah!
Fucking fascinating.
Look how clean it is.

RICH:
Which Plinkett set do you wanna go behind?

MIKE:
The house set.
Let's go in the house set first.
Can you go around the back?
I'm just curious.

RICH:
For the record...

MIKE:
Ah!

RICH:
The back of the Plinkett house set...substantially more cluttered.

MIKE:
Yeah, but it's very accurate.

RICH:
Yeah!

MIKE:
There's some garbage piled up back there.
Props and clothes rack and dead rats and things like that.
But, uh, it's very clean, but...

RICH:
Our wardrobe is missing.

MIKE:
The, the, the support beams on the, you know...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
The flats and everything is...

RICH:
Yeah.
Well, they had, they probably had good photos on the back of this.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
I mean, how much, how much time and effort went into this game.
It's amazing.
Pizza rolls.

RICH:
This a little bit too narrow.

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's okay, though.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Future Force.

RICH:
Ishtar.
Oh, no.

NEIL BREEN:
What do you have for me this time?

Cutting off the water system for half the country?

MIKE:

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah, I know who Neil Breen is.
We've watched many of his films.

MIKE:
Can you change the channel?

RICH:
No.
You can turn it off and on.

MIKE:
Oh.
Maybe the knobs change what's playing on TV.
Break some of them beer bottles!
What's that tape?
Get that tape.

RICH:
Oh, I gotta feeling once we got the, the Space Cop gun, I gotta feeling shit's gonna happen.

MIKE:
Okay.
Were you gonna save the destruction for the gun?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
There's another one on his nightstand.
Right there.

So where's the official Nukie that we have to collect?
That has to be somewhere special, right?

MIKE:
Rich, careful!
Uh-oh!
I see something hidden on the VCR Repair Shop.
It's Feeders!

RICH:
Xtro!
Oh, I thought it was Xtro for a second.
That's Feeders!
That's definitely Feeders!

MIKE:
What's on the screen?

RICH:
Uh, nothing I can interact with.
But it looks like a Lightning Fast VCR Repair Shop.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Ad or website?

MIKE:
Wait, wait.
There's a note.
"I modeled this literally the day before Mike smashed it."
I smashed the computer.

JAY:
Look at the corkboard.

MIKE:
Can you touch things on the corkboard?

Uh, anything you can touch will highlight with that, that white outline.

There's a photograph of, of me and, uh, Ken Foree.

MIKE:
I don't think you can.

RICH:
No, no.

MIKE:
I'm sure you, can you open that door of the actual exit door?

RICH:
Yeah.
There's, there's normally a gap between here that people can get through.

MIKE:
What's that?

RICH:
Exploding Varmints.
Oh!

MIKE:
Oh.

RICH:
Oh...

MIKE:
Look what's there!

RICH:

RICH:
I already know what else is in the drawer.

MIKE:
Inspect.

RICH:
"This strange artifact catapulted Julia Roberts to superstardom and ended Ellen Degneres's career, but no one knows where it came from or what it means."

MIKE:
Ended Ellen Degeneres...

RICH:
All right.
That's everything from here.
We got the Plinketto.
I'm assuming none of the Plinkettos count.

JAY:
No.
Although you can play Plinketto.

RICH:
Ooh.

MIKE:
You have to climb up the ladder.

JAY:
But you gotta get the ball first.

MIKE:
Oh, you gotta get the...
Oh, there's a tape!

RICH:
Wormania.
So where would the Plinketto ball be?

MIKE:
I, I think it's sitting on the...

RICH:
Oh, it's just sitting on the...

MIKE:
Yeah.
Okay, Rich.
You can do it.

RICH:
How do I...

JAY:
There you go.

RICH:
All right.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
You figured that out much quicker than me.
It's like you know how to play video games.

MIKE:
What'd you get?

RICH:
Oh, I got the one I threw!

MIKE:
Oh, my god!
What are the odds?

RICH:
Oh, we got, it was Hard Ticket to Hawaii.

MIKE:
Oh!

RICH:
Thank you, Jay.

MIKE:
Ooh, I see a tape.
Is that one you threw?

RICH:
Probably one I threw.

MIKE:
Yeah.
What do we got up here?
There's one!
Oh!

JAY:
You almost kicked the cinderblock off.

MIKE:
Osteoporosis Dance.
Kick the cinderblock.

RICH:
Oh, I can't grab it.

MIKE:
Oh, there it goes!
What's that?

RICH:
Which?
Which?

MIKE:
Hidden, hidden down there.
Is that something?
Right there.

RICH:
Undefeatable.

MIKE:
"Rich Evans is undefeatable."

RICH:
"Defeatable", Mike.
"Defeatable".

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
"Rich Evans is defeatable."
That's right.
Oh, those count!
Just the ones on the wheels don't.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Wheels and the Plinketto.

MIKE:
Holiday Special.
Oh, you must've picked that up.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Good throw.

RICH:
I mean, I've been throwing tapes around, which in hindsight might've been a mistake.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Right, right.
You should drop them where you find them.

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
What's that?

RICH:
The Jar.

MIKE:
The Jar.
Boo-o-o.
Oh, Tree S-, I see Tree Stand Safety.
There it is.
What's that?

RICH:
Oh.
Oh, I dropped it.
I don't know what it was.
Um...

MIKE:
Oh, Top Slots: Spotting the Best.
With, with Jimmy.

RICH:
Yeah.
Jimmy the Slot Jordan?

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy who was all coked out of his mind playing slot machines.
What's that?

JAY:
Things.

RICH:
Things.
Eww.

MIKE:
No!
You gotta wait until you get the gun!
Are you just trying to find tapes?

RICH:
I'm just trying to find tapes.

MIKE:
Oh!
Hey, the knife's in the wall.
Good.

RICH:
Let's see if I can...
No!

MIKE:
Oh...

RICH:
I was not able to do it.

MIKE:
Well, check in the mailbox.
Nothing?
That'd be a good place to hide a tape.

RICH:
Nothing I can see.

MIKE:
Okay.
Oh, I see something.
Yeah, oh, one more.

RICH:
49.
One more.
What am I missing?

MIKE:
Maybe the VCR shop set?
We haven't really, we haven't gone too far into that one.

JAY:
You got one more in here somewhere.
Oh, yeah!
There's one right on the shelf there.

RICH:
Oh.
Did we not get this?
Oh.
Oh.

MIKE:
Chopping Mall.

RICH:
All right.
All right.
I know what's gonna happen.

MIKE:
Get the gun.
Oh, my god.
You're gonna make such a mess.
I love it.

JAY:
Shoot the wheel.

MIKE:
For being the actual Space Cop, you're not a very good shot with the space gun.
Oh, my god!
Look at that!
Oh-ho!

RICH:
Fuck you, Mike!

MIKE:
That spun all the tapes off!
Can you shoot the letters off Plinketto?

JAY:
I guess no.

MIKE:
No.

RICH:
Oh.

MIKE:
Oh!
Where'd it go?

RICH:
I don't know.
It could be anywhere.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
Can you shoot acetone?
Oh, they don't blow up.
Oh, my god.
It's amazing.
Hold, show the gun again.
I just wanna see...
Yeah, we're missing...

RICH:
Oh.

MIKE:
The, the laser sight.
Yeah, the las-, the, this, this part is missing.

RICH:
I didn't even notice.

MIKE:
I think it broke off, and it's in a bin.
It's, it's, it has the laser pointer on the tip.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Uh, so, yeah, that was glued on this, and it came off at some point.
Yeah!
Trash it!
Oh, that little radio!

RICH:
I think we crashed.

JAY:
Oh, no!

MIKE:
Oh, you, you over...

RICH:
I overdid it.

JAY:
Oh, no!

RICH:
I overdid it.
I crashed the game.

MIKE:
What do you wanna play next?
Dr. Mario?

RICH:
I wanna, I wanna play Pong, Mike.
