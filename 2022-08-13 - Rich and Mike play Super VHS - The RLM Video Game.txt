MIKE:
Hey, Rich.

RICH:
Hey, Mike.

MIKE:
We're here to do our first and last Let's Play video.
Today, we're going to play a video game.

RICH:
Why, why the fuck are we playing a video game?
You've never played a video game in your life, Mike.

MIKE:
Sure I have.

RICH:
You played one Star Trek game when you were a teenager.

MIKE:
Shut up.
And I figure, you play the game because you know how to play a video game with a keyboard and a mouse, which is completely foreign and weird to me.
But you don't\ know what game we're playing today.

RICH:
No.

MIKE:
It's a complete surprise to you because you live under a rock.

RICH:
Oh, my god!

MIKE:
What a neat little intro.
Your cursor is a little VHS tape.

RICH:
Is this something official that happened, and nobody told me about it?
What is this?
What is this?
"Fade in."
"Interior Wisconsin warehouse."
"Late evening."
"Player, age unknown."
"Hot but doesn't know it."
"Steps forward."
"Player."
"Cool, normal."
"Guys said they'd be out, uh, pitching to Nolan."
"Guess I got the place to myself."
Wind-driven snow twists outside the warehouse walls."
"Overhead, the A/C hums."
"Cozy."
"The floor is well kept, but a handful of props asked for closer attention."

MIKE:
Oh...

RICH:
"Well, these VHS tapes aren't gonna inspect themselves."
Cut to...
Oh, my god!

MIKE:
Oh, ho!
It's so clean.
I think we gotta find VHS tapes and inspect them, Rich.

RICH:
What is the, what is the story behind this?

MIKE:
I don't know.
Pick up a tape.

RICH:
How do I...

MIKE:
Oh, oh...

RICH:
What are the controls?

MIKE:
"E"/"square".

RICH:
Okay, okay.

MIKE:
What does that mean?
Inspect.
Oh, okay.

JAY:
Now hit "e" again.

RICH:
Oh, my gosh.
It's even got the little bottom, uh, rainbow-colored info thing.
"A variety hour-type TV special about various activities of Chewbacca's family during Life Day."
"It aired only one time and was met with instant and extreme disapproval."
"So naturally you can watch some of it on Plinkett's TV."
I'm using up, like, I'm using up my own control set up at home.
I don't, like, I use a keyboard, but I got, like, a weird little mousepad thing.
So this is a little bit different for me.
But I can, I can...

MIKE:
Too much information.
Inspect.

RICH:
Is that, it's New Glarus.
I was gonna check.
They got New Glarus.

MIKE:
"A cask-conditioned farmhouse ale, 4.8% abv, and only available locally."
"The New Glarus Brewing Company was founded in New Glarus, Wisconsin in 1993."
