MIKE:
Hey, Rich.

RICH:
Hey, Mike.

MIKE:
We're here to do our first and last Let's Play video.
Today, we're going to play a video game.

RICH:
Why, why the fuck are we playing a video game?
You've never played a video game in your life, Mike.

MIKE:
Sure I have.

RICH:
You played one Star Trek game when you were a teenager.

MIKE:
Shut up.
And I figure, you play the game because you know how to play a video game with a keyboard and a mouse, which is completely foreign and weird to me.
But you don't\ know what game we're playing today.

RICH:
No.

MIKE:
It's a complete surprise to you because you live under a rock.

RICH:
Oh, my god!

MIKE:
What a neat little intro.
Your cursor is a little VHS tape.

RICH:
Is this something official that happened, and nobody told me about it?
What is this?
What is this?
"Fade in."
"Interior Wisconsin warehouse."
"Late evening."
"Player, age unknown."
"Hot but doesn't know it."
"Steps forward."
"Player."
"Cool, normal."
"Guys said they'd be out, uh, pitching to Nolan."
"Guess I got the place to myself."
Wind-driven snow twists outside the warehouse walls."
"Overhead, the A/C hums."
"Cozy."
"The floor is well kept, but a handful of props asked for closer attention."

MIKE:
Oh...

RICH:
"Well, these VHS tapes aren't gonna inspect themselves."
Cut to...
Oh, my god!

MIKE:
Oh, ho!
It's so clean.
I think we gotta find VHS tapes and inspect them, Rich.

RICH:
What is the, what is the story behind this?

MIKE:
I don't know.
Pick up a tape.

RICH:
How do I...

MIKE:
Oh, oh...

RICH:
What are the controls?

MIKE:
"E"/"square".

RICH:
Okay, okay.

MIKE:
What does that mean?
Inspect.
Oh, okay.

JAY:
Now hit "e" again.

RICH:
Oh, my gosh.
It's even got the little bottom, uh, rainbow-colored info thing.
"A variety hour-type TV special about various activities of Chewbacca's family during Life Day."
"It aired only one time and was met with instant and extreme disapproval."
"So naturally you can watch some of it on Plinkett's TV."
I'm using up, like, I'm using up my own control set up at home.
I don't, like, I use a keyboard, but I got, like, a weird little mousepad thing.
So this is a little bit different for me.
But I can, I can...

MIKE:
Too much information.
Inspect.

RICH:
Is that, it's New Glarus.
I was gonna check.
They got New Glarus.
"A cask-conditioned farmhouse ale, 4.8% abv, and only available locally."
"The New Glarus Brewing Company was founded in New Glarus, Wisconsin in 1993."
Oh, my god
Oh, we gotta check out Rem Lazar.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
"One of the three entries and the Best of the Worst hall of fame, along with Surviving Edge Weapons and Cameron Mitchell."
"The writer/director Scott Zakarin would go on to invent a web series as a concept, wh-, the web series as a concept in 1995, and lead actor Jack Mulcahy would eventually star in a Snickers commercial."

MIKE:
Creating Rem Lazar, coming out on Blu-ray soon.

RICH:
Shoji, of course.
Big Hunks.

MIKE:
California Big Hunks.

RICH:
Uh, which one is that?

MIKE:
Uh...

RICH:
Why don't we find out?

MIKE:
Geritol Follies.

RICH:
Geritol Follies!
"This whole tape is on YouTube if you like."
"It seems like elderly people, uh, doing singing and light comedy, which is fine."
"'I expected more from amateur elderly people.'"
"Jay Bauman."
Kid Sand Airbags.
"Ah, airbags."
"Truly, safety equipment from a more civilized age."
"There is no reason not to provide them for kids."
"I don't know who this is for, or why."

MIKE:
I...
Oh!
Nice shot!

RICH:
Oh, this is all wrong.

MIKE:
This is wrong, but that's okay.

RICH:
This is wrong.
You, you failed!
You failed!
But that's okay.

MIKE:
That's fine.
It's fine.

JAY:
I think he was taking artistic liberty.

MIKE:
It's artistic liberty because the Best of the Worst set that we pull out the green curtain, and behind it is the red curtain.
With, uh, with the thing.
For those of you who don't know, but that's okay.

RICH:
"Come back when you found all the tapes."

MIKE:
That's why I brought this out.

RICH:
Oh, my god.
Now we have to find all the tapes.
Now we have to find all of the tapes.

MIKE:
Look!
Your, your, your, uh, your hatchamacallits are up on the wall.

RICH:
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
The, the PreRec?

MIKE:
Your, uh, your 8-bit graphics.

RICH:
"Loyal footsoldiers of the Bowser regime, and the second most common enemy Mario faces."
"Koopas can sometimes lose their shells in gameplay, a fact not true of any world spec-, real world species of turtle."

MIKE:
Look.
Ev-, every paint.
In-, inconsistency and, and mistake is on there.
How is that, is that scanned in?

RICH:
They gotta have, like, taken a still image from the backdrop.

MIKE:
And just turned it into a 3-D?

RICH:
Turned it into a 3-D.

MIKE:
Is that what a 3-D printer is?

RICH:
Now, now another, another fun thing.
Uh, you see the back of this?
They have, this is just blank?

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
I actually painted the backs in an alternate color scheme.
So you got, like, the nighttime underground Koopa on the reverse.

MIKE:
The, the inverse, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's Colin!
On the box!

RICH:
All right.
Should I keep reading everything?

MIKE:
"Colin would later develop severe osteoporosis."
"Dance-based therapies."
"He continues rapping to this day."
Tums!
Uh-oh...

RICH:
What?

MIKE:
Why are you throwing the Tums?

RICH:
I'm trying to, uh, I'm hitting the wrong key.
I mean to see what it says.
I'm messing up.
"Ultra strength Tums contains 33% more acid fighting power per tablet, compared to extra strength."
"Relieves pain associated with heartburn, indigestion, and being terribly wrong on the internet."

MIKE:
You remember when you were wrong about Tums?

RICH:
I remember when I was wrong.
Oh, it went, it went behind the re:View set. 

MIKE:
Acetone!

RICH:
"A compound with the formula C (Something) CH3..."
I can't read it.
Oh, there.
"CH-twenah."
"Acetone is a colorless, highly volatile, flammable liquid, mainly used to dissolve VHS copies of The Jar."
"Remember!"
"Always wear: 1) Safety gogglies, and 2) Rubber gluvs."

MIKE:
"Rubbly gluvs!"

RICH:
"Rubbly gluvs!"

JAY:
"Safety gogglies and rubber gluvs!"

RICH:
"See also: Giant flask."

MIKE:
Ooh, that's...

RICH:
I threw that terribly.
The, the throw and the drop key are...

MIKE:
Yeah!

RICH:
...right next to each other.
What do we got?

MIKE:
There's 2 of 50 found.

RICH:
2 of 50.

MIKE:
Cheap beer.
The original fake beer.

RICH:
Oh, yeah!

MIKE:
Ah!
Ah!
Kid Sand Air...

RICH:
Kid Sand Airbags.

MIKE:
Wait!

RICH:
No.

MIKE:
You're almost there.

RICH:
No!
No!
It's Geritol Follies!

MIKE:
The Rem Lazar landed on Geritol Follies.

RICH:
All right.
I'm gonna make sure I find all the ones I found before.
Just so we're not confuse-ed.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
You can play Jenga.
Rich.
Pick a tape to remove from the Jenga pile.
Oh!

RICH:
Oh, no!

MIKE:
No, no!
You fucked the Jenga pile up.

RICH:
I fucked the Jenga pile up.

MIKE:
The city dump.
This is a classic wheel.
S.O.S.!

RICH:
S.O.S.!
I'm assuming it does that every time.

MIKE:
The "whah-whah" losing horn?

RICH:
"Whah-whah-whah..."

MIKE:
Uh-oh.
How to Have Cybersex on the Internet.

RICH:
Yeah.
S.O.S.
Surviving Edged Weapons.
Which one was that?
That was, that was The Osteoporosis Dance.
You gotta have that.

MIKE:
Oh, these are all the classics.

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That's what they're gonna use.
That makes perfect sense.

MIKE:
Satanic Cult.

RICH:
Hangin' with Leo.

MIKE:
Exploding Varmints.

RICH:
Exploding Varmints.

MIKE:
The Morel Mushrooms.

RICH:
Oh, I can't, I can't grab these.

MIKE:
Yeay, they're nailed to...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
What are the boxes?

RICH:
Pizza rolls.

MIKE:
Totino's.
Pizza Rolls.
Of course.
Okay.

RICH:
I think there might be tapes...
Yeah, there's a tape...

JAY:
Yeah, you can see 'em.
You don't have to duck over them.

MIKE:
Space Cop.

RICH:
Space Cop.
On VHS!

MIKE:
What does Space Cop say?
"This is RLM's 6th feature film, and it literally took 12 years to make."
"Unfairly considered intentionally bad, the film is more of a straight-forward comedy in the style of the group, and people should lay off it."
"Movies are hard, man."
Well, that's fair.

RICH:
Movies are hard, man.
Though, really, considering the amount of shit we give everything...

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
...just, just lay into Space Cop.
Just lay into Space Cop.
Just lay right into it.
It's fine.
Fuck Space Cop.
What was that cat from?
What was that...

JAY:
I think it's from the, the David Lynch trivia video.
You were, like, drawing it off camera when you were...

RICH:
Was...

JAY:
...when you were keeping score.

RICH:
Oh, right.
I drew a cat.
I drawed a cat.

MIKE:
"Folding chable."

RICH:
Folding...

MIKE:
"Fix, fix the..."

RICH:
"Folding chable."
God.
"To-do: fix whopper button."
"More commentary tracks."
"Keep hittin' those homeruns!"
"Faster, more intense reboot?"
Neat.

MIKE:
Look at the detail on the table.
It's, it's pretty accuarate.

RICH:
That's pretty good.
It's pretty good!

MIKE:
I mean, it's darn good.
For...

RICH:
For somebody who didn't actually come in and inspect it and scan it and look at it.

MIKE:
What does the, what does that say?
"They make flasks this big and you can just buy one, no one can stop you and it's not even illegal."
"Appears in Best of the Worst: Future War, The Jar, and White Fire."
Yeah, yeah.
I remember that.
Space Cop headquarters. 
Oh!
Dangit, that's fragile, Rich!

RICH:
It's fine.

MIKE:
"Ring atop..."
Yeah.
Uh-oh.

RICH:
Oh, no.

MIKE:
Rich, you know what to do.
Get that tape!

RICH:
Oh, that's Shakma.

MIKE:
What's that?

RICH:
Wait, wait.

MIKE:

Yeah!
Fucking fascinating.
Look how clean it is.
