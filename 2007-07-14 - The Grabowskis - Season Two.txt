[Episode #1]

MIKE:
So, uh, Cliff, we've been neighbors for, like, what...

CLIFF:
68 years.

MIKE:
What? No. More like 30-something.

CLIFF:
Okay, fine, Mr. Mathematics. What's your fucking point?

MIKE:
Well we've been neighbors for ten years or something like that, right? I mean, we're pretty good friends, right?

CLIFF:
The point, asshole. The point.

MIKE:
Well, Honey. You know, she's been sleeping over at our place a lot lately. You know, upstairs in the spare bedroom. She's been crying a lot lately.

CLIFF:
So? Do you wanna mind your own business?

MIKE:
It's just that, I thought that, you two should, you know...

CLIFF:
Look, mister, do you want a knuckle sandwich? No, seriously, they're great. Honey made them the other day. Fuck you!

[Episode #2]

HONEY:
What are you doing, Honey?

CLIFF:
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm trying to fix the fucking microwave!

HONEY:
Oh, you shouldn't do that. Remember when you tried to fix your own broken leg, and it hurt when you walked?

CLIFF:
This is completely different. This is a microwave. My leg couldn't cook food, stupid.

HONEY:
Okay, fine. Whatever. Just be careful with the baby. It's sitting next to the sink. It's full of water. There's knives there!

CLIFF:
Sammy, no! Sammy, don't die in a horrible accident! No, Sammy, no! Help!

[Episode #3]

CLIFF:
Mike, you and Paulette have a relationship where you love each other, right?

MIKE:
Yeah, sure.

CLIFF:
I mean, you don't wanna cut her to pieces with a rusty saw. The thing is, every night, I have this wonderful dream where Honey is in a grave, and then I wake up. You know, I think she's cheating on me. In fact, I'm certain of it. It's like I have an intimacy problem, and we don't connect. It's all my fault. It's like there's a door on my heart that's locked, and Honey doesn't have a key. Can you help me out at all, Mike? Do you have any advice you can give m?

MIKE:
Well...

CLIFF:
Fuck you!

[Episode #4]

HONEY:
Honey, have you seen Sammy? I can't find him anywhere! I thought you were watching him?

CLIFF:
I was watching him, but he was being a little bastard, so I thought he needed to cool off.

HONEY:
Oh, god. Aughhhh!

[Episode #5]


CLIFF:
Hi, Honey. I'm home. Oh, god. You're cooking?

HONEY:
Mm-hmm.

CLIFF:
What, is McDonald's closed? Is Burger King closed? Is White Castle's closed? Domino's Pizza closed? Is Carl's Jr's cl-...

HONEY:
No, silly. I thought I'd try my hand at a new recipe. I'm making a shrimp-veal-egg pasta with lamb yam clam sauce. The shrimp's a little old. I got it on clearance, and it's green. But I think it'll be okay.

CLIFF:
Uh, excuse me a minute. Honey...I've had a horrible accident, which involves my face. Mainly my mouth area.

HONEY:
Oh, Cliff, you just don't want to eat my cooking. Oh, god! You really did have a horrible accident!

[Episode #6]

HONEY:
Honey, I'm preg-...

CLIFF:
Wait, shut up. Don't finish that sentence unless you want to find yourself rolled up in some carpet with 27 stab wounds in you. Honey, the last thing we need right now is another wallet leech crawling around the floor. Wait, we haven't had sex in two years. How are you pregnant?

HONEY:
Well, I...

CLIFF:
Wait, shut up. It was the butcher, wasn't it? No, wait. His penis was chopped off by a meat saw. It was the baker! No, his penis was baked off. It was the candlestick maker! That's it. Honey, I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I'll say what I've always said since our wedding day: You're a horrible woman, and I hate you. Now, what were you gonna say?

HONEY:
I'm pregnant with the candlestick maker's baby.

[Episode #7]

HONEY:
Cliff, it's time to do the taxes.

CLIFF:
Good. Give me the paperwork. I will take care of it.

HONEY:
Are you sure we shouldn't have our accountant take care of it?

CLIFF:
Accountant? What do they know? Besides, my brain's a computer.

HONEY:
Yeah, a Commodore 64.

CLIFF:
Please insert diskette 2 into the floppy drive in order to continue.

[Episode #8]

CLIFF:
Okay, gentlemen. I'm in. I've got my watch here. It's a Rolex. Imitation Rolex. Keys to my car. And this is the deed to our house, okay? It's all on the table, all on the table.

HONEY:
Cliff.

CLIFF:
Not now, Honey.

HONEY:
Cliff, we need to talk about your gambling problem.

CLIFF:
I don't have a gambling problem. I have a losing problem. They're always laughing. Why are they always laughing at me? Ohh!

[Episode #9]

CLIFF:
All right, this is done, I think. Okay. Boneless what?

PHIL:
Mr., uh, Grabowski?

CLIFF:
Yeah?

PHIL:
My name is Phil Myassup. I've here with the DCFS.

CLIFF:
That gay wrestling club?

PHIL:
No, Mr. Grawbowski. The Department of Child and Family Services.

CLIFF:
Oh, thank you you're here. You can start by changing Sammy's diapers. Second, my wife needs some love and support while dealing with the death of her sister. And I need an oil change...in my hair!

PHIL:
No, sir. We're not here to provide you with family services. We're here to take your children away.

CLIFF:
Well, that's the best service of all!
